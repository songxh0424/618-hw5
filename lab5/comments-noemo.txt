Congratulations Satya Nadella, Rebecca Blurnenstein, and The New York Times
Question for Satya - I believe that there is always a reason which should be bigger than the goal in order to reach there. What was the reason behind your success? @nytimes
So inspiring!!
Comment with your questions for Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Rebecca Blumenstein will ask some.
What is the hardest call you have ever had to make. Either personally or professionally?
Inspiring successful man. Salute you
The mission of business is to address the unmet, unarticulated needs of consumers. And empathy helps you discover those needs.
I love how open this interview is.
“Every five years, Microsoft faced a new existential threat.”
I've been in radio for over 20 years and the industry is dying. So I'm needing a career change. What sector of the economy, on specific terms, do you see being the most vibrant job sector over the coming decades. And can I have a job working for you?
How will robotics impact your workforce in the next 10 years?
Don’t view things from a competitive lens. You need to think about the core purpose of your company.

As technology and AI accelerates, how will "the have" companies, like Microsoft, support public educational institutions and non-profits, the "have-nots", to stay relevant and competitive?

Great to introduce with CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella ,
lo escucho después. ..porque cuando imagine los audios de whatsapp. ..tenia un celular Nokia. ..creado en Finlandia. ...y fabricado en China. ..como los SMS eran costosos se me ocurrió imaginar algo por internet simirar a una radio de comunicaciones ...presionando un botón para enviar un audio grabado sin decir cambio . ...no importa si me lo garronearon..............hoy lo utilizo ..
INTERESTING AND RARE.
Ang ganda talaga
good evening, what are the top 3 qualities of a leader that Satya admires?
Did you ask him how he feels about women asking for/getting a raise?  In Oct 2014, he said (this is from Forbes magazine):  "....Nadella said that women should trust 'karma' instead of asking for pay raises. Nadella suggested that the 'system' would reward their work...."  He later apologized, only when confronted.  His apology does not mean that he doesn't believe (and act upon) what he said.
That's all you got, bud?
Ajit Patel
Manisha Bhalekar no, I was just asking because it's rare for anyone to write a book while being an active CEO..

I have been a good customer of your business.  I will no longer support you as long as you sponsor the NFL.  I will be forced to purchase Apple products. I hope that you can understand how much this pains your loyal customers  to go elsewhere.  Good luck deciding what to do.  I support free speech and protests but not during the national anthem disrespecting my country and those who have given their lives for our freedoms.  Protesters can choose another time and platform to make their point.  Upsetting good Americans who believe in equality by hurting those who have served our country is ignorant because it further divides us and hurts their cause to promote real change.

This was a wonderful interview to do.
How so much better you are than us shallow people who love fabric and pretty design. But the Crux of your argument is wrong fashion has been apart of every society, every tribal group, every peoples since human beings have been on this Earth. Fashion has always been a revolutionary act, from women wearing pants,and the Black Panthers. Fashion sets the tone for a revolution it always has and always will because it gives people the ability State their opinion without having to say a word

Clara the US is the only country where this hasn't been attempted in recent years. 
Case in Point: Ukraine 2014: the newly democratically elected President wasn't in bed with the IMF, and for the sake of keeping his country debt at a minimum, decided to form an Alliance with Russia. This decision would be in the best interests of the citizens in his country, but not for the IMF, and elements in the "Establishment" in the US.

That's when the USA sponsored revolts started. Initiated by Victoria Nuland (Asst. US Sec of State), Geoffrey Pyatt (US Ambassador to Ukraine) and select CIA establishment members, he was forcibly removed from office, and replaced with one that was more friendly to the IMF and the West. ANTIFA was used to destabilize the democracy and Mustafa Nayyam (sp?) managed the dissimination of propaganda through social media and major media outlets, almost *playbook* to what's going on right now in the USA with the same players. Research more into Victoria Nuland and Congressman Schiff.

Timothy Uwemedimo you
Margot Rassion you might like this
They work in a building and own two floors to themselves, while in the city of Paris. Not many businesses in New York have that much space. Balmain is relevant to a lot of people, seeing that it's one of frances biggest fashion houses. And they obviously aren't disconnected if you saw this video. Plus you didn't notice all the celebrities the creative director was with? You dumb af.
Fashion is the connection between art and pop culture for many people, especially the youth today. Without fashion, there may not be a huge interest in the arts for the generation coming up. So it's more important than you think
And its france, do you even know what hoi polloi is, or the jacobins? If you did then maybe you would see where I am coming from and how this video tries to "normalize" the elite with us. But assuming your response to my initial one, I highly doubt it.

This is such a flawed study. Urine is always an external stimulus, one that dog's encounter all day every day, making them incredibly familiar with it. They do not often see their own reflections, and there is nothing familiar about their own faces. The mirror test should not be compared to a urine test at all.

Moo is AWARE 
This seems like a weak experiment to me. the fact that dogs are not too interested in their own urine shows only that they are familiar with it, not that they recognize it as theirs. If they smelled some other dots urine a number of times, they would likely be not too interested in that scent either. This does not show me that dogs should be admitted in the realm of the self-conscious.
I think there's plenty of room for interpretation in these results, but I don't see the relevance of your criticism.

Is the unfamiliarity of mirrors conceptually important to the mirror test?  Plenty of animals grow up with mirrors in their environment yet never show a hint of passing the mirror test.

And it isn't that the dogs just favored the most familiar scent. In the test, the *unfamiliar*, *altered* version of their urine is what was most interesting, not the most familiar, un-altered scent.
I can say that about, say, toys for children. Let kids do without toys! There are natural disasters and poverty!  Kids don't *need* toys.

You can always point to anything that costs money and imagine a better use for those particular dollars and cents.  

The reason poverty exists isn't because of the relatively tiny bit of research money used for dog behavior.
I don't care about the study that's a cute puppo Gary
No single study has much value. An entire body of research on the awareness (and self-awareness) of animals, however, does.

The mirror self recognition test is super contraversal though because it may not be suited for all animals sensory abilities
This video is super cool!

THE SOULS OF ANIMALS

The Bible teaches that animals have a soul. Animals do not have a soul as advanced as humans, but they do have a soul. The same Hebrew word for "soul" used in the Old Testament in regard to man's creation is also used for animals, but the translators of the Bible did not want to translate it as "soul" for animals because it offended them. The word "soul" in the Bible has to do with conscious life, as opposed to bios, or simply plant and vegetative life.

In the Old Testament the Hebrew word for "soul" ("nephesh") is used for both animal and man. For example, Genesis 1:21 says: "And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth ..." The words "living creature" are from the Hebrew words "nephesh chaiyah". The same Hebrew words are used in Genesis 2:7 where we read concerning the creation of man that after God had created man from the dust of the earth He then breathed into man the breath of life and man became a "living soul" ("nephesh chaiyah"). 

The definition of "soul" actually varies according to the context of Scripture. The basic meaning of "soul" in Scripture refers to the mind or conscious nature in animals and man, possessing characteristics of thought, emotion, and will. Animals are not totally controlled by instinct. Animals can learn, love, and show and receive affection. They can get depressed. Witness some pets at their owners' funerals. Yes, animals can think and even figure things out. Even if animals are used for food, they should be treated and killed as humanely as possible. They have a soul. Cruelty and torture towards animals is sin. 

The Bible teaches us to have sensitivity to animals’ feelings. We read in Deuteronomy 14:21 “Do not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk” (NIV). Deuteronomy 22:6 says, “If you come across a bird’s nest beside the road, either in a tree or on the ground, and the mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs, do not take the mother with the young” (NIV).

The Bible teaches in Genesis 1:30 that in the beginning all animals, birds, and insects subsisted on a vegetarian diet. God created a perfect world in the beginning. Suffering and death entered into the world only after man’s sin. Man’s sin not only affected mankind but everything under man’s dominion.

The soul may very well be physical but yet distinct from the rest of the body. Even if the soul is not physical it wouldn't necessarily mean that soul is immortal. Immortality must be given 

Just because man is created in the image of God does not mean that man must possess every attribute God possess or that God can communicate to man. Man was not created immortal. That's why there was a Tree of Life planted in the midst of the Garden of Eden. Because of man's fall through original sin, immortality of soul and body is given to man only through faith in the God-Man Jesus Christ Who paid the penalty for our sins through His suffering, death, and shed blood, and who bodily rose from the grave.

Scripture teaches that one day, because of Christ’s redemptive work, God will restore all of creation and there will be no violence in the animal kingdom anymore.

HOW DOES DNA TURN A CELL INTO A PUPPY, OR A BIRD, OR A HUMAN? 

When you divide a cake, the cake never gets bigger. However, when we were just a single cell and that cell kept dividing we got bigger. New material had to come from somewhere. That new material came from food. 

The sequence of various molecules in our DNA (the genetic code) directed the molecules from our mother's food, that we received in the womb, to become new cells and eventually forming all the tissues and organs of our body. When you understand how your DNA works, you'll also understand how egg yolks can become chickens. Read my popular Internet article: HOW DID MY DNA MAKE ME? Just google the title to access the article.

This article will give you a good understanding of how DNA, as well as cloning and genetic engineering. You also learn that so-called "Junk DNA" isn't junk at all. You will learn why it is not rational to believe that DNA code could have arisen by chance. Science points (not proves, but points) to an intelligent cause for DNA code. 

Nature cannot build DNA code from scratch. It requires already existing DNA code to direct and bring about more DNA code or a genetic engineer in the laboratory using intelligent design and highly sophisticated technology to bring DNA code into existence from scratch.. Furthermore, RNA/DNA and proteins cannot "survive" or function outside of a complete and living cell. 

"JUNK" DNA ISN'T JUNK. It's we who were ignorant of its usefulness. Recent scientific research published in scientific journals such as Nature and RNA has revealed that the “non-coding” segments of DNA are essential in regulating gene expression (i.e. when, where, and how genes are expressed, so they're not "junk"). There’s also scientific evidence showing that “Junk DNA” still codes for proteins through the cell’s use of a complex “read-through” mechanism.

MOO SHU IS SO CUTE David Giongco
Maybe the dolphin and chimp understand that they're looking in a mirror and the dog does not. Could just be a matter of intellect as apposed to sensory awareness.

You might regret tagging me in this because I have a lot of thoughts on this. 

It's an interesting result and mixing the their own scent with an unfamiliar scent and comparing it to both their normal scent and an unfamiliar scent means that it can't be explained by a simple habituation explanation. 

But I don't think it is really a great analogy for the mirror test because while it shows that the dog seems to recognize a familiar scent and that it has been a modified. But smell is a bit more disembodied than a reflection. What is interesting about the mirror test is that you can see the animals who pass it exploring themselves in it and also increased grooming around the mark etc. You don't get this with the smell test. So it's harder to argue this is a sign of a concept of self rather than simply a recognition of familiar smells.
I think its an australian shepherd.

Watching from Italy!
What a lot of trach
What is the subject being discussed?
Backlash to women in tech?
They're talking about sexual harassment. Now you gonna make fun of their glasses? You must be a Trump supporter her to be so rude.
No audio here. Sorry. Bye, guys.
trumps hiv joke over diana not in good taste
Sexism
Bunch o crap!!
Greetings from México city
Trach??
Two women discuss inequality while talking in monotone....zzzzzzzzzzzz
Claire, I think you'd be interested in this
Thanks for joining the conversation. We're discussing Nellie's article: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/23/technology/silicon-valley-men-backlash-gender-scandals.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftechnology&action=click&contentCollection=technology&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=sectionfront&_r=0
Different angles, I love that. People get caught up on a false dichotomy of this or that.
Teri Berardi Manseau
Men are supposed to do the ugly.......why are women trying to do it too ?
Wow Clint you are a bright one
That was many years ago
Clint your a joker
If we pay women more money,. will these women shut up?

Interesting conversation.
I've been trying to email both of you about a book coming out soon that I'd love you to review. http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Troublemakers/Leslie-Berlin/9781451651508
You’ll make the same if you do as good of a job
It turned out beimg so doughy.
Where are these womens' husbands?!
And then the commercials that show a dumb male being outdone by the wife.  Marketing plays both sides against the middle.
Blame the left for it
think we've evolved the long way since the days of Bobby Riggs
whats wrong with sexism?
Lewis's Law: the comments on any post about feminism will demonstrate why we need feminism.
I find old school policies are causing unfairness in my work place. What is your advice for identifying and changing policies unhealthy policies?
Jeran Fox this guy lol "Charles Goss: Where are these womens' husbands?!"
What are your experiences with the push for gender equality in tech?
Well these comments demonstrate exactly why articles like this are necessary. Sigh.
ANTHEM & FLAG: The anthem and flag of any country are the most sacred icons for which millions of people have died; it is honor, courage, sovereignty. Nobody in the world stays lying down or kneeling when they hear the national anthem of any country; all must stand in attention, with respect and solemnity because they will be honoring their martyrs and supreme values. Before anthem all citizens are equal; there are no races, no sexes, no religion, no wealth, no poverty, no occupation; no one is exempt from respect and honor. It is a political maneuver of the enemies of US values and President Trump to confuse racism and patriotism. The enemies are not resigned not to have destroyed US and continue their dirty policy of confusing the American people and the world but we are here standing up facing to the flag and Making America great Again.
Women make more money than men what's the inequality
Respectfully please stop picking on these ladies
How do you not get pigeonholed? Is that what seems to happen to women?
Leftist views
They don
How does gender equality in tech in USA compare to other countries?
What do you do when you are casually treated like a secretary?
Unconventional solutions to work place issues need to be explored
We can't let hime divide US!
You divided yourselved Suzanne
Love that these PIG men are on here trying to make noise....yawn
Ernesto Chavez.. what planet are you from?
Does anyone else feel like the feminist movement is so focused on women being equal in a male dominated world that we actually end up feeding the very machine that is ruining the planet? Meaning playing the game of incessant economic growth at the cost of the earth?
Charles Goss ... I'm not sure your school would like you representing them on your FB homepage and spouting sexist comments.
Exactly what you would expect two NYT diversity reporters to look like.
Comments are not a discussion if everyone is reaching for a bumper-sticker.

Unifying the workplace and working together should not be so difficult, it's changing people's attitudes and opinions that is the biggest hurdle
Don't worry about what your co-workers make. Do you. And move on. There. I solved it. But Im a man who is married to a woman...and Im white. My opinion doesn't matter.
CEOs like Ginny Remetti are successful
Woman always get the short end in any job ...
President of USA does not have respect for women and  blacks. He does not have any respect to the .    I can't call him a pig any more because I have respect for 
So true Angela. The uneducated men making ignorant comments on here are precisely what women are up against.
Our wonderful men and women who has served and died for our country died so we can have the freedoms that we have! Freedom of the press,  freedom of speech  and yes folks freedom to protest peacefully! So stand or kneel you both have the right!
wait i was gonna write something. but it seems that you are talking just to yourselves.
"uneducated" lol
Do you think that women CEOs have better results such as IBM?
"Uneducated" means we don't agree? Gotcha!
Brenda Marie Muldoon
I recently asked the Head of Google Research Europe at a conference in Berlin how he thinks to encourage students, especially women, at "normal, standard" public universities to dare to apply to companies from the Silicon Valley. He said they are the most open company to anyone, no matter what gender or education they had. Do you feel that is true for women from non-Ivy, big name schools in the US and also worldwide?
RonWeiss, what exactly does that mean, that they look like the way they do?
Lately, there has been some reporting and feature articles contending that women bosses are harder on women than men bosses are.  Can you speak to this, if you agree it is a legitimate issue?
Different areas of education
Oh you speak
It's always fascinating that men in STEM workplaces just don't really notice the inequality. I was in Physics, and of the women I started out with, only one or two are still in the field (not including me, though I stay in touch). Their reasons for leaving are varied, but most are some form of sexism in the workplace - hostility to parenthood in ways which don't affect fathers, harassment, the constant wearing of always having to convince people that they do actually know what they're talking about and didn't sleep their way in. The men who left were mainly either no longer interested or wanted more money. But the men from those workplaces would all say there wasn't an issue with sexism.
Hi
@Charles Goss - not that it doesn't matter,  but others' opinions aren't getting heard or considered
Morning Glory hole
Hi, from The Netherlands
Men are upset that the truth about gender differences is being suppressed and labelled sexism (such as the Google engineer's thoughts are, even though he was just saying what we already know to be true).

Are you prepared to call out the discriminatory nature of diversity policies, and to defend the fact that women have different spectrum of preferences than men, and defend the Google engineer? If not, you can never be very good reporters.
Oh you
Charles Goss Matters
Haha.....he sure does. Charles needs to pay attention to Charles.
Glad you caught that comment
As an african-american woman with two degrees in Engineering from Stanford University, I am shocked at how hard it is to find a direct, technical job in the industry.
My wife makes more money than me and works from home. But, she doesn't work in tech. I'm not outraged. I love it.
Some men feel vulnerable so the only way to react is by stereotyping and are actively opposed to women presence.
Yes, over 40 years and I'm still fighting for equal pay
Were they employed in the position longer? And knowing that were the men still mad?
Agreed; not with that attitude ‍
Women make more money than men chics
men are clever. they first start the complaint.  if women begin harassing first it will block the 'man' looking for attention.
No silence here, I have a big mouth
Great
It's also really common for people to think 'this woman is bad at her job, women can't do this job', where they also think 'this man can't do this job, *he* is bad at his job'.
Kilele Foundation Kenya we are watching live in Kenya
The parts of the world that truly need feminism are in the middle east. Meanwhile in these first world countries we live in...alot of women are making good money and I know alot of them who move up in businesses alot faster than men......
The companies force silence of how much you are paid
Many factors should go into a person's salary other than just they do the same job. Such as how long have you been in the job what are your job performance ratings comma Etc
You're right, we are not imagining anything.
LOVE YOU NELLIE
I highly value intelligent women. I have had female supervisors my entire career.  They got there by being better, not complaining
"Goohgy"??  :)
I'm so very tired of being overworked and underpaid while men stand around smiling at me breaking my back for much less than they are paid to smile at me with their hands in their pockets.
It's much more simple than you all try and make it seem. There is a "gender inequality" in tech because there is a "gender inequality" in genders that major in computer science statistics and computer networking and telecommunications degrees. If there were more women majoring in computer technical degrees than men, and there was still a disparity, then maybe this would be a conversation you would want to have. However, the majority of people getting those degrees are in fact men and therefore deserve those jobs.
https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_322.40.asp?current=yes
Did you ever research any female inventors who produced amazing tech and could not get funding because of a gender bias? And based off the complaints what factors do you weigh in?
https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_322.50.asp?current=yes
I've worked harder all my life than the vast majority of my male co workers, yet they have the higher wages. I complain plenty
KB  Supertahhhhh xo
Exactly
Why are principles of capitalism not solving the problem of unequal pay? A sexist company will not be able to compete against non-sexist companies who hire better skilled workers and push them of the market?
Rachel Wimberly, I graduated a long time ago, sweetie. I don't think my school cares what I do.
That's how I'm treated when I complain about it
The numbers don't lie. You can't try to compare 73,000 men getting those degrees to 18,000 women and then try and complain. I put links in the comments for reference. They come straight from the national center for education statistics.
I worked in software for 20 years.  I never saw a more tolerant and accepting bunch of co-workers.  Get the work done, no one cared what you looked like or did.  And believe me, software has some real characters from all backgrounds.
In my experiences, admittedly limited to a rather rough and tumble business, I noted a difference in perception based upon the race and ethnicity of the woman. There seemed to be a hierarchy of preconceived abilities based upon, top to bottom, Asian women (as in "Oriental"), Asian women (as in Indian), White women, Hispanic women, then Black women. Physical appearance could also be an issue. Attractive was a positive virtue, while both too attractive and too unattractive were problematical (I recognise beauty is in the eye of the beholder). I found sexual preference to be an irrelevant factor. Were my experiences within the range of your observations?
Glad to see all the mansplaining.
Sometimes I believe the girlfriend of my son is studying informatics that if the principles of the operation of the machine women simply explained that the resulting product is significantly better. How does a CPU work? Imagine that the values ​​0 and 1 are switching states of a relay. The art of the architecture of a CPU is to display frequently used processes (command sets) linearly and, on the other hand, to represent any subsequent switching states with the smallest possible number of relays. In order to process simultaneous processes simultaneously, it usually requires the result of a process, which is the basis of the possibilities of variation. For example: The USA have a size of xxxx squaremiles. At the same time, one can then determine the percentage share of all federal states. :-)
It's a societal issue, not a tech issue. The larger question, for me, is how do women take back their power as equal members of society and what will it take for men to allow that.
Let's not forget all the sexual harassment, I've gotten plenty of that as well
This administration is useless
No thanks. Not interested in any liberal and biased media. Bye bye #
Well if it applies to Silicon Valley how is it not a tech issue?
Men want to keep the power they always had over women.
Why are principles of capitalism not solving the problem of unequal pay? A sexist company will not be able to compete against non-sexist companies who hire better skilled workers and push them of the market?
when a man is a baby he is depenting on his mother...it is an enormous female power...without her he dies...later when the man is grown up, he wants to be indepentend of the female, I believe this is still in the subconsciousness
This is just blatant bias. Why is there only feminist uproar about high paying jobs?
Thanks ladies
Ridicule Never wins arguments it isn't intelligent either? Personally the Strongest people in my life were my mother, Wife and Daughters and the people holding my Wife back in her job are other women?
Thanks y'all - great conversation.
Men rights?  What BS!  More like keep white men n power.  Continue the status quo.
LOL Susan
Anyone here actually work in high tech or software?
UN is blind,
Can't find the truth.
Bingalis (Themselves called Rohingya) are terrorists.
They're from Bingladish entering into Myanmar since last 60 years ago cause no guards (over 60 years) on border of Myanmar and Bingladish.
They killed and rapped the Myanmar villagers and Hindu women.
Why UN can't see that?
It's something that lives across every sector of tech...
30% of high tech is Asian, yet the reporters are still talking about racism.  Anyone want to tell me how an industry that employs 30% Asians is racist?  Are these Asians themselves racist? Do Asian men dislike women?
Things are getting better globally.  Saudi Arabia just announced they are going to allow women to get drivers licenses next year.  There is hope.
I remember being thrilled to find an occasional woman in my physics or math or chemistry courses  (60's)  and after 6 years of grad school spent almost halftime at the computer center, I can't remember one actually working on anything at the center.
The men's movement is a response to women rights being championed so effectively that the story of what is means to be a man isn't acknowledged, or is downplayed. Even men who are progressive and allies to equality are left without an appreciated identity. It seems like equality is focused on women, and men are left in the blindspot of women who champion equality.
I am also shocked to hear that,also from other sources...it s totally anachronic in a developed society like America should be! The Trump rethoric maybe...
The environment in technology is not far from what happened/happens in corporate America and in banking.  Although there were strides made in those cultures - when 2008 hit it was every man (literally) for himself and it reverted to a biased culture yet again.
Off in tangents on the comment shere
Cool topic keep em coming
Yeah dude! Because demonizing the other side and calling people pigs is a great way to win arguments and get your point across! There are idiots of every gender, race, religion, etc. By acknowledging them you're just giving them what they want.
So your liberal nirvana isn't as great as you thought it would be.  Too bad you can't loot a store or hold a sign against traffic, maybe usurp someone's free speech or whine loud enough to get what you want.  I hear many blue collar mechanical type jobs are screaming for workers.  I doubt they'll be picky but even there you'll need to be competent.
Oooo. Thx
Women in Latin America  are not told it'is ok to study STEM despite some of us are a natural. 
So it's rare to find women doing STEM graduations. And then it's very challenging to hire a women in tech areas!!
we are watching here in Solano Nueva Vizcaya Philippines
Yeah....'dude'? Are you a woman Nick? Cuz I am. Also, calling them anything less than what they are is dishonest. They are not on here trying to understand women, they are here to heckle and berate women so let's not pretend it's anything more than that.
Here in Columbus Ohio, there's a training program called "Coding Bootcamp" for women and POC.
Guys. Bunch of new cheaper stuffs are in here for men's and women's. Let's take a look https://m.ebay.com/sch/i.html?sid=dollarnaire&_pgn=1&isRefine=true
So why aren't the NYT and these imbecile journalists as sympathetic with the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacists as they are with the men's movement and these poor guys who are victims of hysterical feminist rampages in Silicon Valley? I mean, seriously. NYT: my subscription is over. You suck.
Tzvia Iljon
Every field is sexist. Misogyny is rampant in America. Compare pay stubs and promotion list standing.
Are we talking technical coders? That seems to be male heavy, but all of the other roles, in my experience, are either equitable or female dominated.
Charles Gross-  Or maybe your opinion isn't useful because its poorly thought out?  Assuming your position in a hypothetical - if all men are paid 100% more than women for the same role...the solution is for women not ask the men how much they're making and "do you"?  Wow, you must be like a rhetorician or some kind of rocket scientist.  But sure, you're a victim because you're white and not because of your lack of critical thinking skills.
What type of feminism? Old school feminism or modern SJW feminism? We need the old type, not the new type. I take issue with Lewis's Law. It's logically flawed, bogus and close-minded. Lewis's Law is the perfect example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. But hey, the promotion of Lewi's Law is spoken like a true feminazi.
Amen!
That's flawed reasoning! I don't see any comments here saying men are better than women. Are you an SJW?
I think you're the only one who thinks that. I certainly don't make negative generalizations about women. Women can do all the same jobs men can. I think most people now in 2017 can see that. It seems the SJW's are inventing these mantras you just quoted and putting them in everyone else's mouths.
Pig men? We're on here calling out the feminazi's tendencies to invent injustices. My wife is 100% against you SJWs' rhetoric and constantly playing the victim card, as well as most women I know. This isn't a men vs. women issue. This is a level-headed men AND women vs. idiot feminazis issue. Not a single female I know has complained about any sexism against them. You know why? Because it's 2017 and women these days are generally treated as equal as men are. It's you SJW people creating and perpetuating a perceived inequality. I know of many women in high tech positions making just as much, if not more than men. Calling men pigs only hurts your cause, because I see men and women as equals in our society. Get your head checked, Leah.
Colin, you may be late to your women's studies class. Grab your man purse and get to it. The only reason the imaginary wage gap exists is because millennial, hipster women created an issue to have some fake civil rights movement to tweet about. You want a well rounded argument....im here.
Really? It's so common that it became an XKCD comic. 

It's almost like there's a whole world of experience out there that you don't have.

https://xkcd.com/385/
So are these cases of sexism they're talking about, genuine? Or are they made-up, invented injustices created by SJWs? I have to seriously question any claim of sexism in this day and age because of the tendencies of modern SJW feminism to falsely perceive and then create imaginary injustices, all while demonizing all men. Modern feminism has a horrible reputation. Feminism as it was originally established, was a great thing and helped women break through the glass ceiling and get the same respect and treatment as men. But now we have a generational group of snowflakes called SJW's, that took the original form of feminism beyond the scope of its intended parameters, and are using that to try and put women on a pedestal ABOVE men and using that as a WEAPON against men, and inventing imagined injustices to suit their agenda. The pioneers of feminism from back in the 60's are absolutely disgusted at what modern SJW feminazis are doing today in 2017.
How about ageism? Just as prevalent in the Valley.
Exhibit A.
How is a reporter assigned to an "inequality" beat? That hardly is reflective of objective journalism.
Aren't female infants dependent on their mothers to the same degree as men?
That would not happen in California, or did it!
Oh this will be inspiring!
Yeah....I am the one that needs to get my head checked by the person spewing the term 'feminazi'? You who are using your wife as the one person you know who doesn't think she is unfairly paid. The only one playing the victim card is you.
Charles Goss hmm.... Super awesome guy? First you say there is no wage gap but now there is a wage gap created by hipster women?  Also, your well rounded argument falls apart when you attack another person with your sexist man purse remark.
Until the flag represents EVERY American and that racist, ignorant, xenophobic, homophobic, child-raping tyrant is out of office, America cannot achieve greatness.
Darn, those guys sound a lot like some of my old managers!! :)  What's their secret, I wonder?
Math???  Forget math, what about driving?  </sarcasm>
(Sorry, Fiona, just couldn't resist, why, with @Bad Drivers of Napa Valley on the thread...)
Anyway, kidding aside, the "woman driver" perception probably has a LOT in common with the "woman coworker" perception, on the very competitive highway to status and salaries.  Sigh...
Only secret I see them needing is to be male. Women are not paid equal pay, not as long as I've been alive, not ever. No secret there.
I'm from hi so equality should b nice here in the melting pot
yes....but the amount of testosteron is different...I suppose in the subconsciousness a male is more oriented towards independence... but it is only a hypothesis...I am not a Dr. in Psychology 
Disparities in representation between the sexes does not necessarily amount to employer discrimination. Numbers collected at the employer's place of business do not reflect simply the employer's policies; they reflect other relevant factors like individual choice and other underlying conditions in the larger society.
Almost nowhere in human affairs do you find people of different backgrounds evenly represented in institutions. Inequality is the rule, not the exception. One of the most pervasive assumptions that has gained so much momentum in the discourse is the idea that groups would be evenly represented if not for certain institutional policies. The world "has never been a level playing field." as economist David S. Landes expressed it. Renowned historian Fernand Braudel said, “In no society have all regions and all parts of the population developed equally.” Human beings are not random events. We all have histories and different values and aspirations emerge from those histories. If you look at free, democratic societies throughout the world where institutional barriers and discriminatory policies have been removed, you find that men and women, even of a similar description, pursue radically different careers and aspirations.
Cuba? 
I was raised by a strong woman and she doesn't ask men for permission to "take her power back." She doesn't even mention men in her pursuit of progress, she simply moves forward. I'd be somewhat embarrassed to say, "us men need to take back our power in society, if women will allow it." This world doesn't work that way, no stranger cares enough about you to try and thwart you because you're a woman. If you're failing it's likely your own issue.
Ur idiots.  Make ur own startups.

Thanks for the laugh Talford - spot-on parody!
Sounds like privileged mansplaining, which is exactly what we're talking about here..
Your an idiot
Good point. We need to value everyone and support their positions in life. It's not an easy journey. "Love one another...."
Nellie Bowles misrepresents Damore in her article for the Times. I'm guessing that this is what "equality" means -- equal opportunity Straw Men?
The "logic" behind lewis's law is why there are fewer women in tech;)
Every last bit of power women have in society was granted by men without much of a fight at all. Men died by the million for the vote in many countries.  The societal issue is entitlement, and the corrosive effects which wear down the wealth and good will which allowed men to humor women to this degree.  We are at the point where we would rather people burn to death in burning buildings than hurt the feelings of women demanding to be firefighters, unable to meet the same standards as men.   Women already have the power, the only question is whether they become equally accountable, because power without accountability results in tyranny, as people have come to realize, and there are consequences for this.  Either women shape up, or they drag their societies down to the point where men from other cultures do it for them, as is happening in europe as we speak.
Congenital Koenig I'm not going to argue with you, you seem firmly planted in your beliefs. We have different experiences and therefore different opinions.
This is the constant refrain, yet the reality is a different story.   There is a reason women don't start companies, banking on their extra hard work and cost advantages to win the day.  The reality is in most cases, women are expensive, and don't work as hard in the end because they don't need to.  At the end of  the day, many women have the option of not working, or working less, men have to work, or face divorce, this is the reality which runs the world, and it is the reality created by the whims of women, not men.
Simply look at the ever present doctors shortage in the uk's nhs, because all those women they train work for a few years, then drop out of the work force to be a parent.  A very expensive mrs degree, and the costs are born by society, this is the reality which doesn't fit the feminist narrative, but that goes for basically everything.
Studies show women self report higher rates of most everything, including how hard they work, but the hours worked based on the actual numbers shows the reality, and it doesn't fit the feminist agenda, men work more, because they have to, it shouldn't be a surprise.
Congenital Koenig where I come from, it's been a very long time since a women have had the luxury of staying home. There was a time when jobs paid enough to men so mom was able to stay home to take care of the kids and stuff at home, but those days are long gone.
I was a single parent who worked and had my own business where I was working 7 days a week, along with caring for my child and home, but when all the years I've worked for others, including today, I have always been paid less than the men and almost always worked much harder.
After working my butt off all my life trying to find some equal opportunity, please don't insult me by calling me expensive.
The reality where I come from is far from the picture you paint. Women are the ones who do most of the work in my world and are paid less for it.
We also don't have the luxury to just stay home to take care of our kids.
Congenital Koenig you obviously don't come from the same place I do. Where I come from, women do most of the work for less pay than the men.
Lets just say you aren't the h1b's of the tech industry.  The theory that you are a bargain that no one wants is simply the ultimate in extraordinary claims, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.   Again, and as always, the challenge stands, if women are a hard working bargain, start companies filled with nothing but women, the competitive advantage would be a game change (if true), but we all know the answer why this doesn't happen.
Though its true its becoming rarer, the option still stands.  Tech work is hardly blue collar, and the tier of white collar work in question does pay enough for one to support another, assuming they don't live an extravagant life style.  Don't tell me a couple can't live on a male engineer's salary.  
You were a single parent, you could not work as many hours or as intensively as those you competed with, this goes against the assertion that you were indistinguishable from your coworkers.  This is your self reporting, the question would simply be, why didn't you find alternative employment demanding a salary commensurate with your expectations, or is your self assessment simply not based on market reality.  You are worth what the employer is willing to pay, not what you expect, you had equal opportunity, but if multiple employers all judge your value to be less, its hard to claim they were all wrong.
Its not about how hard you work, its about how much value you provide your employer.  And again, a simple thought experiment simply destroys the assertion that women work harder and are also a bargain, because any business which exploited this supposed "fact" would simply trample on all its competitors by  a wide margin.  There is a reason why feminists agitate based on grievance and guilt rather than exploiting their claimed advantages for their own gain, they know what they are claiming isn't true, they aren't willing to put money where their mouths are.
Glad you did this-- I was so upset we were not able to comment on the original article.

#VivaMéxico #FuerzaMéxico it was sad what happened last week, and the people getting together gives everyone so much strength. I’m proud of my heritage.
 it's time to continue my mom's plan.
Thats cold... I agree with drills but peoples lives are completely destroyed. Have some compassion
Michelle Buttars Your feelings are in need of catastrophes.

Those plates haven't moved the way they did in years. It's like telling Florida to get used to devastating Hurricanes , or telling Europe to get used to terrorist attacks.
Get used to losing a family member?? Get used to losing everything you have? What the hell are you talking about?
Rebuild it earthquake-safe I hope.

¡Unión y fuerza, amigo!

Mexico may break 3 times but will rebuild 4 times.  the unity and the automatic response to help each other to become one nation, one people is an example to others that together, one is stronger.  #FuerzaMexico
So sad .
Anth Tab unión y fuerza por siempre, que Dios te bendiga amigo!!!
Funny. Their god has just smashed bricks on their babies' heads, and they still thank him..   lol..
.
in the face of adversity, the strength of the people is admirable~
I hope these people stop thinking God has anything to do with this and use education to stop building above one story in EQ zones.
There's only one way to get up this country and is Peña Nieto renouncing

Hahaha! Yeah you right... but, it's a fuel called FAITH, and it keeps you going in adversity. It's a human thing for humans.......!!
Let's go help them...  Marcos Rodriguez..
We're with you Mexico- we support you!!! 

Rudolph Paredes Sr. ...  It's superstitious support for people who feel inadequate.  Thank god I am not one of them (lol). The practice is hijacked by tithing  'men of god' from Tibet to Alabama in order to gain everything from bowls of rice to shiny suits and  Lear jets...

Why is April glaspie reading roadshow and walk this way?
These people are so strong and courageous.  Their contributions to this country has benefited us in many ways and yet we look down on them.  We should admire them and help out if we can.

Friends:
My master partner Luis Márquez one of the Topos Tlaltelolco is enabling a hostel in the fut soccer courts of Jojutla where there are 60 families sleeping under plastics. They need 60 camping houses with a capacity of 6 to 8 people to enable that space and put one family at home so that they have a better quality of life while defining where they will live. We appreciate your contacts to get them or if you as a family want to donate one for a family I assure you that I will deliver them to those who should arrive and send them pictures of their destination and their use with transparency as always or if you want to take them. Force Mexico! Thank you
Descobri por acaso a igreja em uma reportagem do New York Post, nela vemos a pilha de escombros e a placa com nome do igreja que resistiu aos abalos. Na placa branca está escrito em azul " Ebenezer".
Da mesma forma, eu tenho sofrido com uns abalos que vem do fundo do meu ser. Me sinto depressivo e angustiado. Muito. Não sinto fome, sono e não  tenho força para ir trabalhar , o que,  me desespera. Mas de alguma forma me levantei da cama hoje e umas primeiras coisas que vi foi a igrejinha destruída no centro do México.

A placa em pé em meio a destruição de alguma forma me animou. Sempre que vejo Ebenezer sinto que é um mensagem de esperança para mim, que não estou sozinho. Assim como os mexicanos não estão.

I was in the Coruco Diaz Stadium were the aid its being gathered. The situation is a bit more complex than the government stealing aid.
But if you want to be certain that the aid gets to the people in Morelos send it to that location.
Alan Hill Im an atheist. But i agree with Rudolph. Their faith is what gives them some sort of solace.
God help our Mexicans brothers and sisters
Which "we" do you refer to?
Cynthia Galvan
Raquel mira
Gaspar Gutierrez ..Its a quandry..should we say that solace is so valuable to these simple souls that we should leave them in their ignorance as it's cheaper than antidepressants, or should we say it's our duty to save them from shiny suited  televangelists with lear jets, and paedophile priests. I lean towards the latter though it does mean filling their vacant logic cells with something else. Non-belief is the fastest growing of the 'religions' so we are making progress..
Ay que feo 
Maybe you should give the same advise to those people on Florida, NO, TX, & Georgia who keep building on huracán path zones
Mira Alejandra Catalán
Alan Hill, you are totally right! Now, go save them!
Angela Craft ..I would Angy, but I never take advice from blank profiles in case they are ruski troll bots..... anyway what's the point of saving their firstborn if they intend  to cut their throats to please god ?

This place isn't supposed to be an earthquake zone, at least not one where an epicenter can happen, it had never happened before, it was one of a kind... So they will rebuild where they used to live, it's their home...

Instead of just acusing people of being stupid, you should tell them that an earthquake of this magnitude in this place has no precedent. This town has never been an earthquake epicenter in it's whole story. So it's hard to think that we should "just relocate". It's not that easy
David Favela
WOW! Did you notice the meaning of their words?. Such strong people and they are really poor in a way but rich in other. Sending my blessings. Yes, the Gov is stealing what people sent to people so the Gov can claim it was their help, when the time comes to give them that help during elections. it's really awful what the gov is doing.

No seremos víctimas, sino sobresalientes.
I don't care for religion either, however it's how our town has functioned, many will pray, yet help with their hands. As a matter of fact, many of the groups right now in Jojutla that are helping are led by science professors, that happen to be Heavy Metal musicians. We just don't have time to argue over these things. To us this is a distraction, a straw man if you may.

Dear person reading this I hope your day has been going well, if not, I hope it gets better. You are an amazing person who will inspire others to do great things so keep up the hard work. I know you may feel unimportant or insecure at the moment but know that you are a beautiful human being inside, outside and you are important.
Well, we already know depending on which side of the fence your on. The trumdy dotard followers will blame President Obama or HRC. The superstitious will say it's a sign that God or some other entity is pissed off and trying to send a sign. And the sane people will attribute it to global warming and other natural occurrences as explained by Science.
THE END OF THE WORLD.

We live on a planet that started off with no people and then we overpopulated it and didn't care for it like we should have. There's no way that it isn't our impact that is causing it. Will we have the ability to exist? Unfortunately that is a question for future generations. I do every day when I can to help people animals in living things globally, do you?
Even according to climate change alarmists, the influence of climate change is on intensity -- not the occurrence to begin with. But it's the belief in the latter which most of the masses mimic without thought.
May Allah(swt) keep them safe and avoid further sufferings.
Jesus is coming! Its all in there. He loves you. Accept and repent !
"It's not nice to fool with Mother Nature."

At one point it won’t matter who’s right or wrong.  Nature will do its thing and evolution will put us aside.  The only question is « what species will mutate and take over? ».  I say the cows.
Our Creator of the universe "laws" are in constant motion and there has always been a balance "natural order of the whole planetary system" as stated In many places in holy Quran without any "incongruity" (Hq) and that included His Mercy which has precedence over his punishment (Hq) so therefore these unnatural and semilingly bazar things happening is in accordance to prophecy especially when the "majority of people" turn from the true worship from the "Creator" and chose to back up evil and disobedience to the "Fitrah"(natural laws) Holy Quran 30:30, and as a result ther will be "trials" upon trials for man to come to God with a "penetrant hart"(holy Quran in repentance) ther are many case senareo outline in the Holy Bible and Holy Quran including the age of " khal yoga I believ in reality of natural law and sperituality of things Unseen (Hq) peace to all who believ and follow

He is the provocateur bully par excellence! A con man who has unfortunately scammed and lied to innocent, gullible people like you, god help us all
It's so much warmer now than it used to be. And I experienced the Oklahoma earthquakes last year.

It's definitely not the norm but it's all very possible within the realm of scientific. Same can be said for rolling 8 6's in a row on a dice, not normal, but possible
Jesus Is coming
This is all very possible within the confines of nature. There have likley been seasons far worse than this thousands of years ago, but with ability to communicate across the globe rising in the past 50 years we are able to record and share all these experiences. And if it truly were some trial on mankind, why only effect the United States?
Let me help, God is pissed at the evil Democrat party.
So only the United States matter is what you're saying? Why no natural disasters in Russia? Or Europe? India? China? Shall I go on?
Improbable is a better term.
But only for America, not Russia or you know the rest of the world not effected by these storms

it is all human made . destruction of the plannet due to pollution and etc ... 
blame your self not God . sure God will punish those who are hurting any creatures on earth.
It's definitely making things way worse than they normally would be. What would be really disastrous is if we had the storms we've seen in the past few months as the norm, every year. I wouldn't currently call this the point of no return. If anything it's when we should start to take notice and act to make legislation that funds carbon abatement procedures before we get into a situation where we have to spend billions of dollars in reconstruction efforts every year trying to rebuild entire cities.

Can you imagine how devastating wild fires must have been 500, 1000, 10,000 years ago.  They must have just burnt and burnt and burnt until rain out them out. Then slowly, nature took back over. Grass frew, animals came to eat the grass. Trees grew and birds came to live in the trees with the squirrels.  And then...not would happen all over again. Crazy, Huh !
Can you imagine how devastating
I live in México City and experienced the earthquake from two weeks ago, last Tuesday and last Saturday. You definitely become more afraid and you can’t really prepare for the next one because it is so unexpected and you can’t live in fear. But there is definitely something going on with Mother Nature and it’s time we became more aware of the damages we are causing if we want to be more prepared.

Overall pretty good but the role of global warming in the upswing of the amount of acres burned, especially in very large intense fires over the last decades because of the lack of snow pack and hotter drier summers. Including the adding on of 2 months more of fire season then it used to be in the west, was way too much downplayed. I am not talking about just this one year. But the patterns that have been happening over the last 4 decades caused by global warming are exasperating and fueling the the situation by stressing out the trees in the forests, for all of the things that were mentioned in the video.
can he narrate everything please?
Ironically I suspect that the good guys in all of this will end up being the insurance companies that have to foot the bill not spout the bluster.

Every action has a counter action. We are living on this planet and since we act in the way we do we have to expect a counter action . I can't say about earthquakes, but consider pollution, any pollution, that must play its role for certain counter actions... Landfills, air pollution, sea pollution, river pollution, urban pollution etc...
Melting ice, rising sea levels. Forest fires that occur due to human negligence or in some cases on purpose. All of the above must be met with a counter action. We don't live on a dead planet, rather the opposite. We and only we are responsible for the ways we behave... We are disturbing a rather delicate eco system in ways we can't yet understand how it will behave in order to sustain it self...
We are cementing over natural waterways and blaming mother nature for floods; we are allowing outlaws to build skyscrapers without following earthquake-proof building codes and we blame mother nature for deaths after a quake; we are pushing people into poverty and leaving them to live in shacks and we blame mother nature for hurricanes that blow their shacks away.  Who's really to blame for all this misery?

forest fires in US and Europe--confers are best in rainy place in ireland...it has modified leaves where it cannot hold moisture in atmosphere,,,during colonization of US many native plants were destroyed and confers were planted to please colonizers....what is needed is big leaf trees that can retain lot of moisture in atmosphere and confer must be removed and this confers also never allow other plants to grow near its vicinity...
why does US allow destructible wooden houses to be build ...only to be washed away or turn into ash during fires ....this must be banned even to save trees ...a house to live must not be destructible easily ....go for simple brick and mortar
Yesenia Mendoza
most of the heavy rain clouds and typhoon goes towards left/US and not towards right/Africa ....the heat and lack of forests create havoc in US pulling towards it ...increase forest coverage with big leaf trees not confers that ignite without being lit as it cannot hold  atmospheric moisture near it ....
maybe if they stopped fracking and drilling on the coasts and stopped creating huge empty voids under the land sucking out the oil maybe the plates would settle n stop moving as badly and theese thing s prob wont happen as often

In my lifetime (37 years) I’ve been trough 4 strong earthquakes, I live in Puebla, México , and many others earthquakes that you can consider “normal”... but this two last earthquakes (8.2 and 7.1) with 12 days of difference I believe these was no “normal” at all, nature is reacting stronger everytime it hits and we just have to try to be prepare for any contingency, hope for the best and try to help others if we can do it, the best lesson of all is that disasters can get the best of us as humans, our differences get apart and we start to work together to help other people, to care for animals and rebuild the things around us (in many ways)... I wish the best for all and be careful when something happens... greetings

Of course, there are tremendous natural disasters.Nature takes a revenge. And the question is: 'Who is to be blamed? I wouldn't like to think over but I believe that people are harbingers of these terrible phenomena. I do not judge, of course. I am just trying to say that if we look back on ancient times there were no advanced technology, no amenities such as restaurants, joints, cafes, no traffic but only nature with its landscapes, plains, and mountains. However,  all of this sustained the natural balance of the planet 'Earth'. The air was as clean as a water, the torrents turned green, the water was full of numerous fish, human beings worked hard but they were consuming health and high-quality food in return. Nature gave men everything, contributed to their own needs. But, regarding the development of the technological process, the natural balance broke. Much hydro and power- stations, plants and factories, enterprises and offices etc. came up. They become more competitive and demandable. The world felt the necessity of something advanced and unusual. It caused these natural disasters in its turn by polluting the atmosphere and, in the same way, demolishing natural balance.There was condition critical. As a result, it is what it is. The only way holds that we somehow must solve this urgent issue of climate change before it's too late, in any rate. That is only my point of view on the situation which is exposed in a video.

Brick and morter doesn't work well in places with earthquakes. Earthquake proof structures must have flexibility to bend and move with the waves of the land movement. Brick and morter crumble when the ground shakes. Thats why you dont see it much here in California.
earth quake prone area need diff civil engg altogether ....we are discussing in normal areas ..

developed countries contribute to high global pollutants taken on  per capita basis....and forest coverage are dwindling ....Industries development called economic contributor is misnomer in fact they are the main problem for the environment land ,water and air is highly polluted because of crass industrialization ..".most brainy" of industries are con-men of the environment ....hmmm
disasters by earth quakes ,volcanic eruptions[not man- made] cannot be correlated to  above earth surface disasters .like forest fires,floods,unpredictable rains which are man -made ....

Jenny why aurora borealis exist
Actually, you just made their argument for them (non-anthropogenic causes). Nice going, Seth!!!
Hmmmm. Seeing how this massive thermonuclear reactor is the major source of our heat, maybe.....just maybe....the fluctuations in its output could have effects right here on Earth!  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vmjzewpfH0
Go back to school, eventually you learn something, especially that it is responsible for it.
I'm sure someone on here is 100% , unequivocally convinced that the sun and increases in solar flares can't possibly affect our climates.
I hold a PhD in biochemistry - trust me; the sun has little to do with the current anthropogenic rise in global temperatures.
one day we will learn to farm plasma for energy just like our alien ancestors
Darn it Sethie, now I gotta consult the dictionary!
Not really. The sun works on a 11 cycle while the climate has been warming up since the industrial age
It would be awfully hard to read in the dark....

Outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend. 
Inside a dog, it's too dark to read.

Can you imagine this on a wall sized TV?!?!!!!
The sun is a mass of incandescent gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace

Where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees
So, how do you explain away all those warming cycles BEFORE the Industrial Age?
Global warming! Ban the sun!
http://www.longrangeweather.com/global_temperatures.htm
Says the guy with the fake profile....
Try explaining away all of the previous warming/cooling cycles over the course of pre-industrial history, Sethie....

http://www.longrangeweather.com/global_temperatures.htm
So cool.
We cannot be sitting in a safe gallery and watching the universe. We are part and parcel of it !
Without the sun we would be two degrees from absolute zero
Oh, I gotta hear this...
KEEP TRYIN FELLAS!! You are passionate, but you do not persuade! 
wow! I wonder what would be the size of God the creator of every thing if He would decide to materialize one day!


Extraordinário! O que segura ele lá em cima com tamanha perfeição para brilhar todos os dias pela manhã na temperatura ideal para nos aquecer? Ham? Minuto do dia para se converter os amigos ateus, num oferecimento NASA ciências e tecnologia....RS, Afinal que pintor pintou os miolos das flores com tamanha perfeição e de variadas cores incríveis? Uma explosão causou tudo isso? Enquanto uns precisam de provas outros crescem com uma certeza, hooooo mundo cruel..
nothing beats His creations ...
Just another reason to believe in our amazing God!
Wait You mean it is real?  I thought it was a mythical God!
Drew, you know what they say.  You can't fix stupid.  In case you're so dense, I'm talking about you.
Eventually this planet will be too hot to support life.  Not because of man made changes but, the sun itself will cause it.  As the sun ages it will expand and grow hotter before it engulfs the 3 nearest planets .
Where do you think carbon emissions from human industry and methane gas from human agriculture go?
How do you figure?
The sun isn't the cause of climate change.
Whose?
Rebecca Petchenik, is it C02? Is that good or bad for the enviroment?
Which one?
William Williamson carbon emissions and methane gas.
How much has the ocean risen and why the pause?
https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=aJ-TBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA1142&dq=climate+change+ocean+levels&ots=v1LyLO77GI&sig=5GrjxVTDRXVz9A5QtVp07ENqlVs
As far as carbon emissions you mean from dirty factories in other countries like say China and not so much our clean factories right?
No, I didn't ask for propaganda. You were doing so well.
Propaganda? Do you know what that word means?
Love  my sun.
LOL
And China is about to become the world leader in green energy. You sure you want to lose the future to China to save a depletable energy source from depleting itself?
Did you know only a slight rise in C02 in our atmosphere would turn our deserts green?
Rebecca Petchenik, did you get that off the ChinaOne web page. Go check out a live cam.
The ocean hasn't risen an inch. ;)

I actually pretty much agree with you on most you have said. Pollution is killing our planet, but it's not you and me causing it, it's  the people asking us to sacrifice for it.
The people who go to the climate change summits add more pollution during one summit than you, me and our entire families will in a life time.
Except the methane, if you tell me Cow farts are destroying the planet, I'm going to call you one of Gore's idiots.
The Visible things were created by the invisible things or in another words the material were created by the spiritual or a greater power or different dimension. Was given to us the Bible that explain all these things, and by faith we know that there is only one God and also this one God creator of everything made himself flash once and decent to earth, his name is Jesus Christ.
Rebecca Petchenik God places the earth and sun at the perfect distance to sustain life. God created the sun to be a marvel of nature, nothing that perfectly made can happen by chance.
Wow!
You know it's true though.
Except that there's literally zero evidence to support any of that.
It's not perfectly made. It's a fire burning out. And there's a very large distance that we could exist in and sustain life. Just because it happened doesn't mean it was on purpose. That's very egotistical.
I have to admit, we could get along. :) hope you have a good evening.
Mark Matta
Radness
Don't forget your sunscreen
Well, how would be the earth perfectly placed in a exact location where it needs to be so we would have perfect temperatures to live in? How would the bible exist for the last 5 thousand of years and still be effective today, and the prophecies of climate change, more earthquakes and natural disasters, world unification, the prophecies of the first coming of the messiah Jesus are in the old testament, also his second coming are in the new testament, but without faith would be impossible to believe, but Eternity was inserted on humans soul. So all of us have some kind of sense of eternity but some don't understand.
Im.still.exsisting...
I feel like you commented on this bc you were looking for an argument. Actually there is no other distance or location to sustain the life and atmosphere that God created for us here. Can you prove that all this was not created on purpose?
It just did. And why do you think the Bible is still effective? Do people still sacrifice live animals?
And you can't say something was prophecied after it happened and have an ounce of credibility.
Why does there have to be a purpose?  Why do you think you're supposed to be here?
People don't sacrifice animals anymore because, God himself came on earth to be the sacrifice on the cross, and the sacrifice lost its power, it doesn't need to be done anymore. World unification its on the process its not done yet, but it was written thousands years ago, third temple in Jerusalem also didn't happen yet but will happen.
Lots of people have prophecies for the end of the world. And lots of people say things about god that contradict your thing. Who's to say who's right?
Do you live your daily life with no purpose or goal?
I have my own goals that are important to me
Another great NYT science video
All we need to do is to send money to the Paris climate accord, and things are going to be ok.
So you do have a purpose in your life. Do you want to live w no purpose? So why chose to believe there was no purpose in creation.

God was made up by people. So are we as a species, the true gods of ourselves?
The sun is on a 11 year cycle, climate change has been happening for billions of years over longer than 11 year cycles...doesnt take a genius to figure it out lol
Pedro I believe God is real, according to the Bible and the historical fact of Jesus, the son of God living here on the earth.
Crystal I do not believe the earth is millions of years old. God created the earth, according to the Bible. God created this amazing world for us to treasure.
This is the perfect example on how insignificant we are as living beings. kk
Hey, you atheist. Here's another prove that there's a GOD. Keep deceiving yourselves, and keep living in that illusion you've got.

We're not perfectly placed around the sun though. We're within an acceptable range to allow life. We could be further away or closer by thousands of miles and still be fine.

We've also discovered numerous planets in foreign solar systems that are in the goldilocks zone. Earth is not special.

Climate scientists know that climate can and has fluctuated due to natural causes; they've just concluded that in this case, the cause is manmade emissions. There's no "explaining away" going on.
God!
Perspective.
This images make me feel that there is no God only the Sun.
It is very awe inspiring but why worry this is one of those things that you have no control over if that happens there are no preventative measures. What we do need to worry about is where the human race is heading because the way we are going we will sew  our own seeds long before the suns solar flares become an issue. Newsflash the son has been doing its thing since life began!

Mi bella Isla que triste :-(

The five ex Presidents of the United States of America have joined together to aid Puerto Rico.  The Dotard meanwhile will be tweeting us into WW lll.
Rural Aid Youth Association (RAYA)
Yikes
Trump doesn't care for our brothers and sisters of our nation.
Where's the emergency plan to restore Puerto Rico? There's only so much donations can do. We need a National Plan put forth by our leaders who have the power to send everything necessary. What does it take to get them to respond?
Any tweets from Trump yet? Any announcement on his visit to the islands? Any words of encouragement to fellow Americans? 

Watch, listen, learn, and most of all, never forget.... 
Meanwhile, do whatever you can to donate through vetted private organizations, religious groups, etc.
They need our help. Hey 45! Can you stop creating chaos long enough to pay attention to your real job? If not we need someone who can to be in charge. ASAP
Puerto Rico is well over $80B in debt and has defaulted on their debt more than once. Federal employees still received over $120M in Christmas bonuses though while we get saddled with their debt.
I dont know, but it seems like that island is going to be inhabitable conditions for like a year.
....
The dotard is just today sending FEMA
FEMA has been down there since Irma hit. The military should be arriving with supplies if they aren't already there. 

https://www.facebook.com/FEMA/posts/10155287205144965
This is part of America. Where is Trump? Oh that's right, attacking Americans who express their constitutional rights.
God's wrath. Pray to Him!!
Brenda Liz Hernandez-Medina Brilliant response. Sorry the brutal truth makes you uncomfortable.

I hope not :-(
Roberto Moreno It's not enough.                     http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/25/us/hurricane-maria-puerto-rico/index.html
Roberto Moreno I'm really glad to hear this. I haven't read about this response and I'd begun to think that we'd forgotten them.
Dave Fishers What does that have to do with them being decimated by a hurricane and flooding?
That is not true, so stop it. Help if you can ,if not cállate la maldita boca.
Butbutbutbut FOOTBALL and Alabama!
He's too preoccupied with NFL players.
What's he so mad at Puerto Rico about? 
They speak Spanish there, so it must be a different country in the eyes of Trump.
Anything and everything he can manage to distract from his failures is their plans. Focus his base on something totally different to cover up for his constant ineptitude.
It may take decades to recover but with progressively stronger storms they may never recover
Julia Long The entire island's infrastructure is crumbling because of decades of poor financial policies and mismanaged/corrupt government. The significant amount of damage from this storm is directly related to that.

Was that too hard for you to understand?
Stephanie
Are you helping Dave?
Dave Fishers And? Are you saying they don't deserve help?
Faudy F Familia that's very bad .
Kate Rowland Peabody: this is what I'm talking about.......
Let the people of Puerto Rico test himself from what they failed. Let them confess their sins to God!!. And obey His Commandments! By the way, God is not mad at anyone. He knows ristrictly what to do. Please don't scold your creater!!
17 tweets from the Dotard about sports since Saturday. Meanwhile, 3.5 million Americans are without power and food in Puerto Rico. Trump could care less because they cannot vote.
Yes. Exactly. On top of 3.4 million stranded US citizens...on top of the 17 billion debt prior to hurricane.  This is big and leading nowhere good
If it's not a state that puts money in Trump's pockets, he's gonna be a no show.
Feels like when Bear Sterns collapsed and no one knew what that meant

Julia Long He was a Home Depot employee. Must have lost his job from our boycotts or just whatever.

Luke our beloved plátanos!
And trump has yet to say a word about Puerto Rico. Guess taking a knee is more important!
He said the day of the hurricane that he will be visiting Puerto Rico. Why would you libertards doubt that?  It really is not safe yet. He has spoken about Puerto Rico several times. I'm sure he will be donating as well---Did you hear of the other 5 donating a red cent to any hurricane effort???
Very sad reality
You sick twisted idiot.
So? I hurt my foot yesterday.
Hey Mary, I live in SWFL, he came here when it wasn't safe. He was in Texas when it wasn't safe. Why can't you indoctrinated morons see the difference? The other 5 are not the current president. 

Be thankful for your shoulders Mary. It keeps your head from going any deeper than your neck...
the stupid losers of the demoniocRAT`S  are dragging the country into a civil war
Someone else in office
Could you please feature this? Someone posted it on Sen. Sanders' page.  mr sanders we have a emergency in a town called levitown in puerto rico parcela #733 calle rosa, levitown 787-702 -5678 2 elders in need of oxygen tanks no help from anyone yet please get the message out there we need help please !,i am from miamibeach florida,and i am in desperate need of help
I don't really care whether he Tweets about us or not, as long as he provides the aid necessary. So far FEMA has been down in PR since wednesday, both the US Navy and Army have been deployed to the island, and efforts are being pushed in Congress to send the U.S.S. N Comfort. About 10,000 Federal workers arr already on the island, and the US Marine reservists in the island, along with the National Guard have been activated as of last hour.
As long as you are recieving the same amount of aid, preferred more, than us here in Florida Hector. Even though we are recovering, we are doing everything we can to help.
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China? Are you expecting them to suffer it back?
So sad 

Maria, they'll never stop saying Maria...
45....this is where you need to focus and be a man.

Wow this sucks 
Dave Fishers we do understand but what I don't understand is by saying that are you saying it's ok to let U.S. citizens die!
Pray for hope.
Where is the red cross? Where is the Clinton foundation?
Kayla Smith
Thank you to the The New York Times editors and business staff for FINALLY deciding to take down the paywall for Hurricane María after 6 days of emergency. It is vital that as many people as possible read what is going on in Puerto Rico and the state of emergency in which it is. Wider coverage from the media can get them the help they need.
Yeah but the NFL

So this is what happened to our plantain chips!
JEhovah Wins Demons  Go starve then I remember when your country was going through a humanitarian crisis and who stepped up to the plate? America..... and we in PUERTO RICO are a God loving nation. You have no right to open your ignorant mouth and speak such blasphemy. It is truely sickening and not only unchristian like or whatever your higher power is may the Lord punish u for not having sympathy for people who DESERVE FOOD WATER SHELTER TO BE COMUNICATING WITH LOVED ONES. You are truely disgusting  pray that the LORD does not take you and your family. I think that you are full of demons
Does anyone know how long it takes for crops like plantains to recover?  Is it like a fruit tree orchard where the trees take years to grow and produce fruit, or is it like corn that grows in a single season?  I honestly don't know, hoping someone can educate me.
NOT THE PLANTAINS OMG WHY
احنا عندنا موز ليكم كويس حاجا تعجبكم اووى ده بلدى وبيزحلق ههههههه
But 45 tweets about the NFL and NBA. SMH!
My heart hurts.
He tweeted about the debt Puerto Rico owes.  Does that help?
And most of then don't carry insurance
Mary Forbes first of all, Puerto Rican's are Americans. It's not a donation, it's a simple fact of what should be done. 
If you were stranded with no food, water, power, any communication I'm sure you would be unhappy.
#viequeslove 
What kind of plant do you farming????
He tweeted something about how much PR owes Wall Street a little while ago - as if that's at all relevant.
Héctor Armando Sánchez García Don't forget the US Coast Guard! They're delivering badly needed supplies.
We all knew it was going to be different from the previous disasters. Though it looks like political pressure is getting to him. It is being reported now that he is actually going to the islands to see the damage first hand.
thanks, our island needs more of your coverage of the crisis that 3.5 million American Citizens have.
where are the millionaires?they must share their blessings in life.
The need for food and water is desperate.
Dave Fishers, People like you that have really teeny tiny itty bitty penises love to go on Facebook and spew political rhetoric when human beings are suffering and need help. Go back to your room in your parents basement, fire up your laptop, click on your link to PornHub in your favorites folder, and go back to doing what you do best. The rest of us are going to do our best to help out our fellow Americans in need.
Now all the plantains have been lowered to a perfect level for animals to munch on. There is a silver lining. I'm sure many enjoyable snacks will be had by critters.

I never have anything better than these. If these're not arts and politics, what can it be.
And what exactly does this have to do with helping the citizens of our country? How many states, etc. have defaulted on federal loans?
Should causing extensive damage to our planets atmosphere oceans and ecosystems with CO2 by politicians (LAW MAKERS) and corporate leaders be recognized as criminal acts acts of ecocide under international law? www.EndEcocide.org

Ask why they are not doing Air Drops!? There are 13 C17s at the Air Force Base in South Carolina that can air drop big pallets of lots of stuff!! Let's please ask the military to do it over Puerto Rico!

AMERICAN AIRLINES...
Honoring Puerto Rican roots? What about puertorrican lives? I just want and need to share this.... A Cancer Patient was sponsored by a philanthropist that took her plane to bring supplies to Vieques, Puerto Rico.  What act of kindness!  The private plane departure from San Juan Isla Grande was delayed because of logistical problems with the airport, fuel and many other complications. That patient and her family were supposed to leave San Juan at 1:00 pm.  Then, they were taking an AA flight from Miami to Houston, where she is going to get cancer treatment. The private  plane finally left at 7:37 pm. (There severe communications challenges to talk with people on the ground in Puerto Rico) As soon as I got a confirmation that the plane left, I called American to inform of the situation with that person and explore the possibility to put them in another flight MIAMI-HOUSTON. As soon as I called, I talked to Elizabeth in Customer Service, gave her private flight tail number and all details. She was very compassionate about the situation of this person that is in leaving Puerto Rico to be able to continue her cancer treatment interrupted by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. She told me that she can do nothing to help because of the fare acquired was TOO Restrictive. (What is the fare that someone evacuating for humanitarian reasons is going to get?) She transferred me to a Supervisor, Mr. Pedro Hurtado. He was very respectful and compassionate about this situation. I spend more than one hour with him on the phone trying ways to help this family. After him talking to many departments (Fares, Resolutions... etc) Him, with a very sad voice, told me that he did everything he could to help me, but his hands were tide because of the operational policies of American Airlines. The only option was buying another plane ticket at a flight tomorrow.   Her son  told me to buy the ticket (with resources they don't have) however, because of this never-ending efforts of this incredible American Employees, all flights were sold out. Right now, this cancer patient is on the air flying to Miami Opa-Locka airport with the hope that she will be able to board a plane to Houston to receive her life saving chemotherapies for Metastatic Uterine Cancer. She and her families will sadly discover that aren't going to be able to board a plane to continue her treatment. So many efforts, so many sacrifices organized in only 24 hours will be thrown away just because American is trying to apply "regular policies" for exceptional humanitarian situations. The only response we got is a simple NO, we can't do nothing."  And then, "No its too late, we are all booked". Anyways, as of this moment they are paying double to bring her to Houston in a United Airlines Flight. They will have to even pay a hotel tonight to board a plane tomorrow. What's going on with AMERICAN??? Knowing the humanitarian crisis people of Puerto Rico are going through, there is no even a bit a sensitivity for cases like this? Sadness, frustration and pain is what we are felling... Is there someone on American reading this that can do something to help this family? All money spent on this situation is money that won't be used to cover her cancer treatment.
#PuertoRicoSeLevanta
The suffering happening in Puerto Rico is completely unnecessary and utterly unconscionable in this day and age.

Jesus. This is GRIM! So many families are going to be destitute! For decades!
This is so wrong it makes me cry. What are the world leaders doing to stop this from happening? What is the UN there for??
Sick world!
Bangladesh is not a rich country but their people have kind heart which most of the rich countries lack,, So, in my opinion Bangladesh is rich because it has possession of something which is becoming rare in this world now "kindness and whole heartiness".
Even though the cruelty is so apparent, the silence of the Myanmar premier is what baffles everyone!

"No Rohingya in Myanmar History.
https://www.facebook.com/asarkani/videos/10155745244175909/
The Rohingyas are mostly neglected people among all other minority. Huge discrimination has shown in their social & financial life.They have deprived from education, deprived in public service & remain off in politics. They completely banned in freedom of speech even they do not visit capital city as well.Extremist Bhuddist are killing them continually, police & army set fire to their home.
Too bad the Rohingya's militants attacked many govt stations in Aug and the govt of Myanmar retaliated against the civilians...this is a travesty. But the militants are partially to blame for using the civilians as pawns...it radicalizes more of their population to attack the Myanmar govt in general...old guerrilla  war tactics...

#Rohin is telling lies.

There is a very simple answer to the matter of British pratice. 
There was no such identity as ' Rohingya' known to the British Governments of either 
India until 1937 or of Burma after the separation from India on 1 April of that year.
In the 122 years between their conquest of Arakan in 1826 and Burmese independence in 1948,
not a single reference to ' Rohingya' is to be found in any British official report, regional gazetteer, census, legislation,
private correspondence or personal reminiscence.

Muslims of Arakan have always called themselves ' Ronhingya' , for which there is simply no credible historical evidence.

And end should be brought to the nonsensical assertions of their supporters that the ' Rohingya' are all illeggal immigrants
from Bengal.

But supporters of Rakhine Muslims overseas should at the same time acknowledge that the particular designation
'Rohingya' had no serious historical validity prior to independence in 1948.

Derek Tokin,
former British Ambassador to Thailand, Vietnam and Laos, 
is an advisor to Bagan Capital Limited and Editor of Network Myanmar.

Actually, I don't know these are rights information or not.
But one thing is sure that they have no credible historical evidence indeed.

However, we should aware of  all of them are not illegal immigrants.
According to right to personal identity, we should call them 'Rohingya' when they  back off from telling they are indigenous enthic peoples.

But, not this time.
So, what should we call them ' Rohinliar'  or ' Rohinnya'?  Coz they love to tell lies all the time.
Muslim Militants Allegedly Kill Hindus, 45 Bodies Unearthed in Rakhine: Community Leader

YANGON – Security forces unearthed 45 dead Hindus, including six children, near Ye Baw Kya village in northern Maungdaw Township, Rakhine State, according to a statement issued by the government’s Information Committee and later reports from a Hindu community leader.

The government’s statement — based on Hindu community leader U Ni Mal’s testimony — on Sunday said members of Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) arrested some 100 men and women from several Hindu villages in Kha Maung Seik village tract on Aug. 25 and killed the majority of abductees.

U Ni Mal told The Irrawaddy this afternoon after he and villagers assisted security forces in searching for additional burial sites.

The community leader claimed the 45 deceased were brutally killed and some were beheaded or had their throats slit. Among the bodies were 20 women, 19 men, and six children. A mass grave of 28 was found of Sunday, with 17 discovered on Monday afternoon.

Twenty eight bodies were unearthed in Rakhine State’s Maungdaw Township on September 24. (Photo: Thuta Zaw/ Facebook)
U Ni Mal said that the Hindu community had verbally and officially requested that authorities and Arakan National Party lawmakers looks into the deaths, but that there were delays due to security concerns.

The UN estimates that some 500 Hindus fled to Bangladesh after Muslim militants attacked border police posts on August 25 and resulting Myanmar Army security clearance operations have followed. The refugees are sheltering in makeshift camps on the Bangladesh border alongside a UN-estimated 420,000 self-identifying Rohingya Muslims.

U Ni Mal expressed that the Hindu community “wants justice” for these attacks.

Some 30,000 Hindus and Buddhists in Maungdaw were also displaced to other areas in Rakhine State after military clearance operations began following Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army attacks on border police posts.

During a visit by The Irrawaddy’s reporter in early September, some Hindus expressed that they would no longer live alongside Muslims in Maungdaw if the government planned to relocate them.

“We are not comfortable living alongside them anymore,” said U Ni Mal.
CNA apologised.
On Sep 19, we published a video on Facebook which showed interviews with several refugees who had fled across the border of Myanmar into Bangladesh. 

The refugees were reacting to a speech by Myanmar State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi on the situation in Rakhine. The comments by the refugees in Rohingya were translated by a locally engaged Bangladeshi translator, who was assisting our reporter on the ground, and subtitled in English on the video. 

It was subsequently brought to our attention that part of the translated comments were inaccurate. After further checks on the translation provided to us, we decided that the original translation was inaccurate. 

We have removed the video. We apologise for the error.
This is Allah's will.

To question it is heresy
Thanks for the coverage 
Kindly my appeal to every country every organization and every person on earth to take off the lense of religious   cultural ethnic difference
Just see every one through the prism of humanity then you will feel the real pain encapsulated in the  atrocities and minsiries they face.
Key Key Late How do you know that they were killed by the Rohingya?  It's just a propaganda by the murderous Myanmar Army, which has a long history of killing minorities all over the country. It is not even logical, how come a ragtag insurgent group has enough time to kill and hide the bodies during a province-wide military campaign to exterminate the Rohingya? And if they are really killed by the Rohingyas why they will try to hide the dead body? The sole reason for such killing is to create terror in the mind of others but with the bodies buried and half of the population fleeing how come they serve any purpose? Its clear that the real killers are the Tatmadaw..
Kay Kay Late Stop this lie. The first British entry regarding Rohingya was from 1763.
17 More Hindus Dead bodies who were killed by ARSA found in Northern Rakhine, total of Hindus dead bodies reached to 45 Now. https://t.co/jLw3u7ivpj

Every Muslim is not a terrorist but every terrorist around the world is Muslim.. you got it
You are such a shameless low human. Your type terrorists are performing and encouraging ethnic  cleansing on them. And you are  saying what? You third rate human. Those Hindus must have been killed  by Buddhist  Terrorists...those  who are killing these  Rohingya people
Nikl Nilop Rohingyas are not the first ethnic minority being killed by you. Your murderous Army has been killing minorities for 70 years. So people will not believe in your lies. It's very apparent that this terrorist attack is also fabricated. The attack happened on August 24 just before the Kofi Annan committee submit their report, a report that actually recommended to grant citizenship to Rohingyas!! Very convenient, isn't it?
Nytimes do some real reporting find out the truth the origins of why they were banished their links to terrorists etc. 
Every Muslim is not a terrorist but every terrorist around the world is Muslim.. you got it
The Ministry of Truth, I mean NYT is working overtime in trying to whip up sympathy for Islamic militants who started a rebellion in Burma.
our san suu aunty is so beautiful and she is a peace loving women.
Report on the tent cities outside US cities
No military should target civilians, that will only feed a militant insurgency, not combat it. Learn from America's catastrophic mistakes! Targeting the Rohingya has produced only suffering for hundreds of thousands of children and families AND done nothing to stop any insurgency in Myanmar. If you destroy people's lives, expose them to horrific violence - however justified you may feel it is - all you are left with are broken traumatized people with a lot of anger and nothing to lose. Terrible, tragic actions bound to fail at their objective, unless that objective is simply to destroy these communities.
Kay Kay Late that's not even CLOSE to true. Why would you say something so completely false?
Right and that justifies a genocide.
I love what you've said. We need to put humanity above everything else. Be kind to one another for the sake of humanity.
the only thing whipping up sympathy is the suffering of hundreds of thousands of innocent people fleeing for their lives. You can't combat terrorism or terrorist insurgencies by targeting entire groups of people, many of whom are innocent. Just ask the US, we've tried it and the consequences are disastrous. At this point in history, after we've seen this play out again and again, this conduct is indefensible - and they will not satisfy their objective, unless their objective is sheerly destruction of every last Muslim. That isn't strategy - that's ethnic cleansing.
trying to understand...why aren't there any UN or  Red Cross missions to bring food ?
The world is watching but also God the almighty, he cares and is going to take action soon
Last time I read books and articles about Buddhist saying they are the most merciful people on earth ,what changed them, or it's just another religious war .
Yeah, this "human rights /ethnic cleansing" argument means nothing to the Burmese. All they have to do is look west to Afghanistan to see their future. You do know that Afghanistan was once a florishing Buddhist country was was destroyed by Islam.
So u want to punish all Muslims because few militant groups .
Lol Debra Morris its true you should stay in there areas before saying that.we used to have a cricket team in school where Muslim kids forms as a Muslims team and play against other lol this is insanity
Horrible...
Such a bloody shameless Buddhist terrorist u r ...!!! Burmese Buddhist r terrorist .
So true

Speech less,the world leaders need some kind of action now before is going worse.
And nothing about killings by Rohingya militants.  So typical of the fair mindedness and depth of Times reporting.
Mohammad Islam yes, there were other religions in Afghanistan before Islam. I'm sorry that that is a shock for you, but its true. You do realize that largest ancient statue of the Buddha was once located in Afghanistan? You know the one that the Taliban destroyed in 2001. Did you forget? I'm glad I could remind you.
Kay Kay Late, no, I do not get this. Genocide and ethnic cleansing done my Mynmar Army and Rakhine buddist clearly proved all buddist are sub-human, animal.
Thousands of videos and images of raping, killing even newborn child, torture, burning of villages made us speechless and angry. Wonder, howcome buddist peoples whom we respect deeply could do such inhuman atrocities!  Isn't  any good soul amongst you Myanmar people!  You made us so sad and angry.
Sophie Muller
You need to develop some shame. You are supporting terrorism and genocide against  innocent people.You are such a low and third rate human...yuck
ignorance nd stupidez do just this...
None of these reports from the military have been confirmed. Even if they are, that does not justify genocide.
Katie Jo Knaub
Sofia Panaccio excellent reportage
Why does American media try to cover up what these Islamic radicals have done to their hosts? Good for the people of Myanmar, thinking people all over the world stand with you. And it further illuminates the cowardice of western "media."
Hard to imagine their miserable life's.
UN should take immediate legal action against miyanmar Buddhist terrorist
Kay Kay Late, Duddupudi Chowdary Yeah thats so true and thats why hindus are fleeing to Bangladesh alongside Rohingyas...

Why didnt they go to rangoon? Why did they choose to flee to Bangladesh with the muslims? 

you piece of garbage!
Yes Rohingiya Muslim militants also attacked Hindu Rohingya in Mayanmar and then Muslim Refugee Rohingiyas attacked Hindu Refugee Rohingiyas.Hindu Rohingiyas are the most persecuted minority who have no voice and really no one to listen to.
Rohingiyas are muslim bangadeshsis. Stop fooling the world.
We think we have problems...we should all be ashamed of ourselves!!!
Shame of myanmer
Sammy You  Hate Monger Illiterate idiot. Learn Buddhism history first. It is an Indian Religion started by a Hindu (Budha). It got very popular in India for a while. But then Hindu fanatics retaliated. killed millions of Buddhists  and kicked them  out of India. When Islam came to Central Asia, Buddhists were already gone long ago. Most of current Afghans are descendants of Jews who are part of last tribes in Jewish History. But how can I teach History to a brainless hate monger?
I'm not sure, but I listened to a discussion the other day with a reporter that spent many years covering Myanmar. She explained that the Prime Minister of Bangladesh shook Donald Trump's hand last week at the UN, but didn't bother asking for any help from him (the US), because she did not believe that it would be well received.

International Criticism

“Regarding how Myanmar people and the international community should view the current situation of Myanmar, I think they should view with a complete sense of responsibility. But what our citizens should know is that the main responsibility lies on them if they want their country to develop and have peace. But at the same time, they can’t ignore the international community. The world today is like a village. You can’t stay unconnected, and it is important to get along well with the international community. This is also a responsibility for your country. So, you have to take responsibility for your country, and global citizens also have to take responsibility for this world. If all have a sense of responsibility, there will be problems for no one. However, we can’t always see this sense of responsibility.”  – RFA
These Rohingyas are not belong to Myanmar. they have lived in Myanmar as illegal immigrants for decades. they have never been as Citizen of Myanmar. they don't respect law of Myanmar. they don't speak either Rakhine or Burmese. they don't know Myanmar national anthem "Kaba Ma Kyei". Myanmar will never give citizenship rights without law. they have to still under the law or respect the law of country where they live.

Not for decades but for centuries. Still  they don't know the laws? It means they have left in a confined prison for centuries and it is true!
The Rohinga are engaged in a hirjah, Muslim colonisation by emigration, Myanmar is perfectly correct to chase them out

Where is the UN ?
Pratap Dahiya actually the atrocities of the Burmese are indiscriminate. The Rohingya whether hindu or muslim look exactly alike. They are in the same boat. The genocide is happening to both hindu’s and muslims - the “blacks” as the Burmese call them and all are fleeing across the border to Bangladesh.
Well said.  And many Indians agree.

17 more bodies of Hindus found in N.Rakhine State

A day after the bodies of 28 Hindu villagers were discovered, 17 more bodies of Hindus were unearthed yesterday about 200 yards from the graves where 28 bodies were found in Yebawkya Village in Maungtaw on Sunday.

The search was carried out following information given by Hindu villagers who managed to flee the massacre and fled to Sittway.
“The bodies were found with their throats slits while their hands were tied and were blindfolded. Some bodies had cuts in hands and feet,” said Dr Kyaw Maung Maung Thein, Maungtaw People’s Hospital Superintendent, who conducted the autopsy yesterday.

The evidences pointed to a massacre by ARSA terrorists, he added.

Hindu families who were present at the site where the bodies were unearthed confirmed that all bodies including children were from Khamaungseik Village.

Hindu villagers from the area told the journalists in the recent trip to conflict areas that Muslim militants stormed into their communities on 25 August 25, killing many, robbed their properties and fled to the forests.

Union Minister for Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement Dr. Win Myat Aye flew to the sites by helicopter yesterday and comforted the families of the victims who were killed by ARSA extremist terrorists.

Maungtaw District People’s Hospital superintendent Dr. Kyaw Maung Maung Thein, and Criminal Investigation Department Police Major Ye Aung and party who were along with the Union Minister and Chief Minister of Rakhine State U Nyi Pu took measures for criminal investigation and for DNA test.
The Union Minister also told the families of the victims that the remains of Hindu villagers would be given a proper Hindu traditional burial.

While the Union Minister, Chief Minister and party viewed the exhuming of the 17 bodies, they told the officials to conduct matters according to the law and to provide proper burial in accordance with Hindu tradition.

Next, the Union Minister provided Ks 2 million to Tatmadaw, border police personnel and local ethnic nationals who helped in exhuming the remains.

In the evening, the Union Minister, Chief Minister and party went to Pazunchaung Ywathit village, Buthidaung Township and met with Muslim villagers, enquired about their present living condition and provided Ks. 50,000 per household to 21 households.

Northern Rakhine was plunged into a serious and dangerous crisis after ARSA terrorists raided police posts last month, unleashing an army crackdown that has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.

Information Committee
Great reporting. While fat, well-fed slobs in America argue with each other over whether it's ok to stand or sit during the national anthem, these poor families and kids are struggling for water, food, and they still hold their head high with dignity. Hats off to Bangladesh for taking these refugees in.
The New York Times is there a way to send money to the woman with the broken elbow? Please advise. Thank you.
Why New York Times is still quiet about ARSA's ISIS style mass killigs of Hindu villagers? Any idea?

Nicely done. 
So you decide to profile a millionaire who experienced a mid-life crisis and now lives "minimally" with seven figures in the bank? Millennials will look at him as a hero, yet ignore the fact he worked hard to get the opportunity to live this way. He can claim anyone who grinds it out everyday is an a--hole, but if he didn't do just that would he be able to buy those nice skates? It wasn't being a successful doctor that made him an a--hole, it was the insecurity (or narcissism, I can't decide) he had and still has. His obvious need for attention (whether it be exotic animals or flamboyant behavior at the beach) tarnishes this beautiful message he's touting. How funny would it be for all those people who cheer him to start hitting him up for money? Something tells me his schtick won't be as endearing moving forward.
This is the most amazing story of starting over that I have ever heard. Kudos, Mr. Kitchin.

Mixed reactions here...it feels like setting up this 'either/or' mentality...either work a stable job or do what you love 'for you'...any physician has worked for years towards the goal of being a doctor, and he was presumably in a career with potential for helping many people. Yes the hours are long but that's part of the gig. But I think there could be a way to work as a physician and not buy into the BMW lifestyle...and if he was suicidal as he stated, he probably needed some mental health treatment. But his years of working as a physician enabled him to retire early and pursue this passion! If he was at a typical paying job he most likely wouldn't have been able to entertain this idea at all...

Aghhhh why is there always an antagonist? Can't you see the point of the story? Follow your dream! He was miserable even earning all that money and being what society calls "successful". Going Back to basics and enjoying the simple things in life brought him this happiness. The message here is that no matter how much money you can make, or having a brilliant career this does not necessarily will bring you happiness. Don't be jealous.

Here bro Daniel E. Tavano, liberate yourself and "do what you want to do"
And now he's really making a difference. 
do what you want to  dude
John worked hard, made money and is enjoying life by doing things that he wants to do. Period. A hell lot of wealthy people die in misery - mental misery - I have seen and so did you - undecided, not knowing what will make them the happiest. This guy at the least found an answer to that question. People are making a lot of assumptions - 
Privileged, big bank balance, selfish. Did we learn from this clipping if he does charity or not? May be he does, may be he doesn't, may be he hasn't yet and leave all he has for charity - who knows! 
The message is 'do what you want' - at least give your best. Money helps but is not the limiting element to 'do what you want'. I would agree though that this inspiring video is probably irrelevant to a whole lot of people who are also working very hard, being very responsible and just trying to keep things together for them and their family! But let's not be critical of John - he has done nothing wrong.

Oana Nicola Udrescu watch this video until the end and pay attention to it. In other words look beyond the surface of a "skate man". You will remember our conversation after you are done watching it. 
Jade Vulgamott I'm sure you've seen him
I believe so
Only wish I could be as carefree
Most people these days don't have the "opportunity to stop.."
Eamon Schaney
I don’t see the point of this. I am glad he’s happy. People who have worse misfortune and grew up with worse imaginable way, still manage to be happy. I just see another story of when people aren’t happy with what they got, so they change. It happens to everyone, it doesn’t matter what your financial situation is. Just do whatever makes you happy as long as it doesn’t promote harm to others.... that’s my mantra. ‍

Carol, this video means a lot to me for reasons I won't share here, but will just say that not all people respond to the wake up call until it's too late. You seem, based on your comments, to not have experienced this.......but you will.  Remember Slomo.

Taylor Christine
Chanel Parmar  follow your dreams
Nothing wrong with working hard every day to support your family. If you get to retire and this is what you want to do, then good for you. I don't see how it's a goal. He is responsible to no one but himself. That's gonna get old fast
Jessica Phillips
Maybe we'll see him when we come down
Gerzy, the philosophy behind Brink ... I suppose!

awesome, this is so superawesome,I call this sense of freedom/unity with the universe "getting the endorphines going"  I get this from horseback riding, total release from the everyday and a wonderful sense of being and unity with my horse. find yours!
Jenelle Hawkins
I love his story of reinvention, I really do. However, few people will have the privilege to leave work behind and really seek what they desire. Especially now that people are working longer and longer into their lives with so much wealth inequality. Production is at an all time high, but wages are stagnant, and most everything valuable like healthcare, housing, transportation, and education is becoming too expensive for the majority of people. I would LOVE it if we could address wealth inequality so more people can attain their actual dreams.
Peter Guren Chris Genovese you're welcome
Kris Darrough Erin Lynn glad to see what my future holds lol
Anna Hamilton!!!
lol to each his own.   this is really awesome. I get this high when riding my horse, freedom and unity, living in the moment.  he is doing something for others, showing happiness to others is very inspiring.

Jacob Anderson Maxwell Warren
Sean Linehan Daniel Landrum Tom Tejada Ryan Conly Jordan Winchester
Beautiful.
i work and have responsibilites but I do have my horse, this total sense of freedom and unity is mine when riding, I call it getting the endorphines going or living in the moment. we all have this something we absolutely love.  be it ice skating, rollar skating, horse riding, boogie boarding, surfing, biking, running, it does involve physical activity with a rhythm to it. lovely.
Mari Alaniz Foteh 
but you can fit it in, mine is horseback riding, while working full time and other responsibilities,  find yours and fit it in.
« Do what you want to do! », I love this!
Nathan Thomas- slomo!!!!!

whaaaaat
Brandon Mithma Zoe
Megan Naomi Hinshaw do you know Slomo yet?
Yes
There's really very little reason to criticize him. Do your life your way. Focus on yourself.
This man is an inspiration. My attending asked everyone on rounds today what sport they could go professional in... I said rollerblading. #noshame
He's my hero

I see this guy every afternoon when I ride my bike on the boardwalk. Always wondered what his story was....

Rita Casey , Yes, he went through a long explanation of that. Stress is one of the biggest proxy killers, leading to mental and physical illness and chronic disease. Some kind of stress-reducing activity is really important for happiness and longevity.
so a doctor retires, and that's a NYT story?
Was not expecting that voice...?
I've seen a lot of people act badly and negatively impact loved ones with the belief of doing what they wanted to do, perhaps John doesn't fit into that category but yes some of us have different responsibilities and other people who we are accountable for!
Good on him! I know that boardwalk well and I don't blame him! Great place to spend your days :)
Derek O'neill Louise Allen Lisa Doherty - after today you'll enjoy this fab story of a man on wheels. Just beautiful. X
I love this. Thank you producing it.
whatcha tryna say?
Let's call this what it is: retirement.
Love the end when he just glides
Mark Nordstrom
Ooooo Love this 
Kate Genevieve "I experience myself like the tip of a great iceberg of consciousness"
I second what Rita said. Meditation, centering prayer, walks in nature, exercise, yoga, tai chi, Qigong: all have been proven beneficial to health and happiness.

That's my old home!
Justin Bieber 

So this is keeping him sane and alive, if so.
Veronica, have you seen this guy? Keep a lookout.
Wow people! Just breathe! Point of the story is follow your passion! Remember...he is losing his vision also!  I'm doing what I still love to do....ophthalmic photography and I have a brain illness that can cause blindness. So let the man be. Be happy for him! And go be happy for yourself!!
Slo Slomo
No big deal. He can afford to do it. Enjoy.

If he was suicidal and this is keeping him alive, so be it.

I'm a psychologist and was concerned hearing him talk about being suicidal all of the time, for most people doing something you love won't cure your depression

Julie Brown Knopke Mark Knopke we saw him!!!!
love to rollar blade down that route once. what a way to spend your days! it takes courage to change whats not working in your life and follow your passion and money is just one part of that. many of us wont find the courage or be able to for one reason or another. Its so uplifting to see someone who has, living breathing and loving the dream. the smile on that mans face.. Whose smile is that wide every day?
maybe I'll quit my job and skate around lake burley griffin

He’s been skating in PB since I was younger and it always brightens anyone’s day to see him so blissful as he makes his way down the boardwalk. He’s a staple.

Slomo is a legend. There's no replacing him.

Moral of the story he got over life and wanted to just have fun lol
Patrick Scerbo Nat Probert Kevin Wolff blade or die dawgs.
Ron Leck - you in a few years!?
Luz Sáenz
I thought he said his message: you can believe what you want to believe in. You can also change your mind about what is believable. He believes that he's enjoying his retirement the only way that his happiness is believable. He's enjoying a "radical departure from his background".
Wow. I think you forgot the fact that he is losing his vision,, and yet you only focused on his money.. smart!

That he's seeing in a way that you find unbelievable is intollerable? Which is it @Edward McCain

Wouldn't we all... Having a brain disease urge you to do it though... that's tricky
Good for him!!
Shanie Phillips

I mean that's how long it takes him to go 20 feet
Andrew Bikofsky
But would he even have decided to turn his plans into what we watched if he hadn't needed to? His going blind made him see.

Rodrigo Ferreirinha olha isso, cara! Poético!
Juliet Roll
Jennifer Contarino Panning , Last I heard, there is no cure for depression. But research shows that exercise for moderate depression is just as effective as medication. He explained that he is in a "flow" state while skating, probably gaining him the same brain benefits as exercise, meditation. Plus he's out in nature, proven to be even better for health. Any exercise and de-stressing your life is an excellent way to manage depression. We don't know if he takes meds, but again, better this than addiction or death by suicide.
AHHHH i love this guy!!!
Annabel Edwards interestingggg
At first I was going to reply with a snarky comment like, "we just put our BMW up for sale on offerup." But as we continued watching we were just like "Wow! This man is awesome." This is a nice reminder to be happy with what you have in your life. We should take a rollerblading double date to PB and see Slomo :)
Cindy Hua Pascale Maher
Erin Lane
Stephanos Boussounis
Slomo is my spirit animal!
Good to hear you have given up the worthless job of saving people's lives to make an enduring contribution to humanity as a rollerblader. What the H happened?
Find a way to do what you want. Work with what you have. Be happy with the outcomes in all of your life. Do these things when you believe they are the way to see what's there for you to keep believing. His message is very universal.
Give his money away.....then I'll be impressed with his "simple" lifestyle.

Millennial here I see him as a hero and I didn't ignore all of his hard work and grinding so please realize that. 
This is a beautiful story because he's doing what he wants without hurting anyone, even though people may think he's crazy, or the mainstream calls this behavior crazy but also mainly because people like you are assuming he has one problem or another. I hope you can have as much joy some day in something as he does skating, that's the point anyway. Spread love

I spent some time on that beach this summer... I can honestly tell you I thought about cashing out and setting up shop there. What a great and vibrant place, my whole family started talking about moving there, including my teenage daughter. Good for him if that’s what he wants to do

He's the epitome of San Diego
He would go out to the bars in a sport coat and silk boxers at night.
Alyson Hayden Haley Azevedo Lauren Mottles
Yaaas!!! He is the best!
Brian Slomiak!!!!!
Nancy Bell Lindsay Bell Diane Davis Vranjes - have you ever seen this guy? Fascinating story.
Erin Whyte
I don't see the point in your reply. You're not saying anything.
I love all these touchy-feely comments. NEWSFLASH- it's possible to live a life where you enjoy your profession and family. He couldn't do that, checked out, and is trumpeted. He talks down on so many people not blessed enough to accomplish what he rightfully worked hard to achieve. So who's filled with contempt, me or him?
Anastassia Grigorieva
Martha Kohlrus, Trevor Kohlrus, Frank Kulavic, we 100% saw this guy when we visited Trev!!!
I'm surprised people are finding fault with a guy whose primary goal in life is not to become an assh*le again - ESPECIALLY In SoCal where we could stand to lose a few... 
Hammad Rashid wow

Justin Leibel
Hahahaha always see that man moving in slomoo
Joni Karl understandable.
Micah Green I think we saw him
Ben Barton
James Patterson  possibly! Here's my perspective: I'm a psychologist who works with many young adults who have been indoctrinated with the belief that you must love what you do for work...which is a problem because Many hop from job to job until they realize they have to figure out how to make their lives more fulfilling instead of expecting their job to fill that...I get this is one man's story, but my mixed reaction is that you don't have to give everything up to be happy, sometimes there's a medium to be had
Timmy Kai
A great idea and a healthy attitude 
But I would have to add some public service and a few ski trips in there :)

Yes, The Flash.  He did move to Hawaii.  He painted the outside of the house across the court from us. I didn't recognize him with his clothes on.  His cute wife was the one who painted his backside for him if his costume de jour called for it.  He was tan all over!
James Carey
Brian Bellingham
No, but it sure does allow you to retire early and skate for the rest of your life, which is kinda the same thing.
Fal Manns
Leona Sayah once you’re done being a successful doctor and I’m done being a successful teacher we should follow this man’s footsteps 
He was out there in 02/03 when I was living in PB. It's like a five mile stretch and he goes back and forth very slowly each day. How does he pay bills?
Pabsst Rufus 1 more spotted
We love slomo! I see him all the time.

John Gallagher slomo is a legend
Dennan Dier
Neda remember him??
Any of these FI's have worked hard to get 6 or 7 figures in the bank.  The quickest way to get there is to be a bit frugal, and don't subscribe to all the advertising hype or keeping up with the Jones next door. Problem I see is that people will be wanting to get there without hard work. I'm 51 and will easily be there at 55 BUT I've worked on it at the 9-5 grind and outside of it with sensible investments. So at a young 55 I will be able to roller blades too.
That's the life...

Jennifer Contarino Panning , Again, we don't know his diagnosis, whether he indeed suffered a psychotic break, or whether he is taking medication. Yes, he did mention he was suicidal before he started skating. If he does indeed have a mental illness, maybe the producers of this short should add a caveat. In terms of treatment of brain disorders with medication or more intensive therapies, I am fully in agreement with your professional judgment. We just don't know this man's full story.

What I think is amazing is that this guy sacrifices so much to help people as a doctor in his younger years, first as a sort of spiritual obligation and then then through financial incentive, and he finds this bliss in this simple thing that most people would just be "whatever" about. It really does seem like a sort of karma brought this story full circle.

Having a mantra that you believe in might be better than having to go blind in order to see like what happened to this cat. Your story is relevant too sir! :)
Jennifer Contarino Panning quite right. Truly for most people work is survival.... But perhaps similar to the concept of Maslows 'Hierarchy of Needs' once you no longer actually have to work for financial reasons then the need to enjoy it becomes critical

He contributes a beautiful message. I've been here for 12 years and Slomo has been at the beach every single time I've been at the boardwalk. People can't help but light up and smile when they see him. His energy is infectious. He is a fixture in the community. I never knew his back story but I now find him even more fascinating. He truly enjoys the simple things in life.  It's a beautiful thing.

Gary Marshall
Yes!! Omg!!
He has a nice bank account to afford time off.
Donna Crowley
yes slomooo! good for you! see you on the boardwalk!
People are criticizing him because he had money to do this. The way I see it is this, if you love swimming you wouldn't mind if you had flippers or not. Swimming is swimming. Everyone is afraid to leave security and go for what they want. That's what stops us. If you aren't as well off as him money wise it would be harder. But then I wouldn't be no diff. From the person who says I got to buy gym clothes and good sneakers to start going to the gym. You can go with your old sweatpants. It's your choice how badly you want to do it.

Edward McCain You should rail against that life too. Why on earth should we all be doomed to a neverending drudgery for the rest of our lives? This guy escaped and you seem extremely threatened by him not working when you are. Maybe if you examined your finances and your spending you could do the same instead of attacking his achievement.

He said the beginning of his career his work was 90% spiritual. It was when it became 90% financial that he had suicidal thoughts. Not everyone is an a hole who works. I'm very zen when I'm working. The point was do what you want. Don't lose yourself in the struggle.

Well Jennifer,  that it could be construed as anti-capitalist propagansa, or needless drama, I like how he keeps moving and is finding more and more of what there is to see when recognizable things have faded. All the money doesn't matter as much as moving forward. .. even Slowmo. I think the point is quite that he Did find medium. It's "a radical departure" from what most of his class does..
How selfish of him for doing what he wanted and someone wrote about his story!  Good lord! Lol. Don't be jelly! I loved seeing him before I knew anything because I saw someone genuinely doing what they wanted to do regardless if it didn't fit your agenda of what was cool!Regardless, I feel he is going to sleep tonight happy as all the haters are going to be restless! #getahobbyhaterz #cabtbelieveimhashtagging

Sorry, but I do think he's just too old for this nonsense.  Especially a doctor!  What a gift he's throwing away, the ability to help people!  If he doesn't want the regular life, go be a doctor in small desolate small town or go out and treat the homeless!  To throw away that knowledge on skating?  Personally, I think he's a jerk.  Yes I judge.  So be it.
I have no interest in dictating his, or anyone's, life. It was a question about doing for others vs. doing for yourself. That's significant.
I this. A secret of which only a few have the key!

Nice. It is great to see someone get off the wheel. But, the 40 yrs of being a Dr help support the 40 yrs of doing what you want. Like everything, it's a balance. Pay now or pay later.

We saw the documentary a few years ago... it was great!
I see slomo at least once a week. I love this mini documentary and wish I end up like him lol
Hey Hegedus family, you don't happen to know this dude do you? Kent Hegedus, Jill Hegedus, Jean Hegedus, Jeanne Baker 
My point was this guy was well off and chose to quit. Yes, most can find time as you say, but not to do what he has done. Many in my generation (late boomer / early gen X) will be lucky to retire at 65.
Brenda Wessling he has the capacity to use his specialized training to help others, and he chooses to spend his days skating. I personally consider that wasteful, and I say this as an educator who strongly values serving others.
What a zany method of transportation

How cynical. You completely miss the point. He was equating the goals of western existence as empty. He found a spiritual practice – skating. He gave up a dead "life" based on external achievement and rewards to be in the moment, in his nirvana. If he stopped practicing medicine around 54 (which the math indicates) and he lives on the beach in SD, he is by no means "rich." So much for your life values. The guy who made this did it to help wake people like you up.

I've seen stuff on this guy before. I think he is simply one of those people that "gets it". The "flow" state he talks about is a very real experience of connection and is a beautiful (almost sacred) feeling.

Nothing wrong with not working hard every day, not even having a family to support. Sure be responsible, but live below your means, save, and minimize those expensive and time-consuming responsibilities to just what is really necessary, and have some fun. 
Life is short. Enjoy what you have of it.

So...first work and earn money and then pursue your passion or doing both at once...trying not to confuse young people because skating along the boardwalks of San Diego's Pacific Beach is wonderful, but for spare time, not for a living

Edward McCain I think he was just saying it wasn't right for him. But for so many who play that game and are miserable, who feel ashamed or fear ridicule from family and society to attempt an alternate lifestyle, it's just another endorsement that it is possible. Yes, it helps to be able to cash out a small fortune, I agree, but others have made this same minimizing life  decision with much less and have made it work.

Ari Monterey, ROFL - "going back to basics" 
I completely agree with @Edward. He has lived his life and had all the pleasures and fun. Earned all the money. And then chose to go to basics (in your words). 

Would have made more impact if he left all the money when it was actually bringing him happiness. 

Easier to say Miss Ari, but usually only those people give up things who have derived pleasures from it. 

Those who give up early while they can still enjoy, are called saints. They have more knowledge and understanding of the world. And they don't "roller skate" (or may be they do, but don't post profile videos on Facebook claiming this is more fun and happiness)
this is exactly why i have a bike on campus

Saw this when it first came out a few years ago.  Then became friends with him on FB.  He was a staunch Trump supporter, at least during the campaign, but then PB locals started talking trash to him as he skated by.  Haven't seen a political post from him in a long time.

i've skated with this guy before! hes far out
Gail Ropson Buechler Watch this.
Amazing story! Such a kind and brilliant man. Goes to show you never to judge someone without knowing the full story. He is a pillar of PB culture and he is joyfully skating through the background of my fondest memories of my 20's. Live your best life everyone!

Heh Melissa  Yeah - we saw Slomo everyday when I lived at the beach.  Sometimes I was out rollerblading or riding my cruiser bike along the ocean boardwalk and you could always see and hear him coming. He just skated along that boardwalk between Mission Beach and Pacific Beach everyday multiple times. And he always carried a little stereo with funny music like The Twilight Zone when he skated by - it was awesome  He was a staple of San Diego and locals and tourists really enjoyed him. You couldn't help but smile every time you saw him 
Ashmin Varma
is this your new direction in life?
skating to bristol shouldnt take more than 54 days right?
Mylene Alfiler Is this the man you were telling about that you saw skating on the boardwalk?

Peggy Ong
I wish him well...and it's probably just as well he's not practicing.
Ian Holden
He said his work was getting to the point that is was only about money and he was miserable, he was going blind meaning his days doing that work were numbered anyway. It's not like he could keep working till normal retirement age even if he'd wanted to. He earned all that money. He chose to retire early and just enjoy a simple life he wanted. Notice when he was enjoying and satisfied with the work, he was doing it. If you're happy, do you. He wasn't hating on the regular lifestyle. He was explaining his thoughts and why it wasn't the way to go for him. Maybe it is for you. That's awesome. 
p.s. this article had nothing to do with Millennials. Don't use this just to make millennials look like all any of them wants to do is not work.

Katie Brennan keep watching, he reminds me of you :)
Mary Kate LeViness watch this when you have time i saw this guy when I was in San Diego years ago summer after summer
Victoria Taguilas This guy!
So let me ask you a question... what are you doing about it?
Why not? I mean, why the f*ck not? Seriously, the NYT wasted valuable column inches spewing about one more self-indulgent Boomer who could actually do some good but chooses not to so that he can become everyone's favorite weirdo. Tell me again why anyone still needs to refer to Mr Me as "doctor?" 

Game changer ...
Landon Ulik Kathryn Blackwood Ulik
Great video
So so awesome! What a story and so cool it is getting national attention
Andre Graf
Well, Emily Willow, this is always an option...
Shamik Maganlal love this- I've been thinking of taking up surfing I think it would be really healthy
Sam Deverett Jordan Battaglia Elliot Muller
Me neither but maybe we will. Did you watch the whole video? It was good, I liked his perspective.
If you met and actually talked to the guy in person you'd never have written this comment 

Anyways good vibes to you

How do you "fly"? Check out this vid on Slomo.
Lori Jane Powell yeah, we saw him too!  Did you know his history though? That he was a doctor and all that?

Jon Schoepke 

such a cool story
haha so gooooood!!!
What an interesting story, good perspective on work and materialism.  So many people work hard to live a good life, but the good life is always the next rung up on the ladder.  There is something to be said for driving a regular car (not a BMW) and living in a regular house (not a mansion), all those possessions can start to own you if you are not careful.  I had good advice long ago and I've tried to stick with it - don't let each salary raise correspond with a raise in your lifestyle because if you do you will never be free you will always be living paycheck to paycheck.

I have met and spoken to Slomo.  Edward McCain you are wrong.   He is a nice guy and you are a jerk
Lindsay Lou I wondered if you did! I loved this story. I needed his story today.
It was just what I needed to see today.

Thank you Anri! As someone who spent summer vacations at Pacific Beach I know that to be true! And they weren't formerly doctors.

Yea if the guy is talking about 12 cylinder BMW's and Ferraris I bet he's got quite the stash to fall back on. Also, agreed his self fulfillment is extremely envy invoking. That part of the video reminded me of you and your move

I really enjoyed this video, but I also recognize that my grandfather who was a urologist and he lived a very good life filled with love and happiness. you can find your path anywhere, not just skating.  my grandfather felt he was here to be a doctor, he did what he felt was his right path.

Maria Beatriz Slomo 
Ja Olle, jeg har studert denne filmen med stor interesse. Jeg forsto mer om hvorfor det er så fascinerende og morsomt å gå på rulleskøyter, at hjernen gir positiv respons fordi du trimmer balanseferdighetene. Og jeg tror sammenligningen med surfing er god, at det er litt samme følelse å gå på rulleskøyter som å surfe!  Susanna skal forresten gi meg skøyter med 3 hjul i julegave. Det er jeg veldig glad for.

You sound like a blast at parties 
It's a beautiful this once you pass him walking in pb... he's a man of mystery and this is a great story to give us a little insight on who this figure is. I have seen him since I was a little kid... Come visit San Diego

If I'd gotten those a few years later when I was 30 odd lbs lighter I'd have had a lot more fun with them. Carrying too much weight on them things. 

You got to skate on the neighborhood streets when they'd just refinished a few years ago didn't you? Once or twice? Wonder did Ryan 
Really enjoying his life
Kathleen, Michelle, when breath becomes blades
What does he do in his spare time?
Shelli Barton
I've seen him skate by! 
I grew up going to Pacific beach, occasionally seeing this guy.. he was well known for this lol. We always thought he was some crazy old man until this came out.
Thanks, The New York Times for this clip! I'm from San Diego and live a mile north of PB. I have seen Slomo for years and heard so many different stories about him. Josh Izenberg and staff, Thank you for making such an outstanding clip about him and telling us his story. Your whole interview, visuals, his words and the soundtrack was one of the best things I have ever seen in any documentary! It literally brought me to tears. Thanks, Slomo, you Sir are the definition of "Consciousness"! I'll give you a high five when I see in person next time on the boardwalk! Much <3
amazing -- i feel this for you Tomas
Amazing story! <3

In Spring, when I was a little girl, I would put on my roller skates.
I would enter the most carefree world and take an imaginary journey. 
I know his pleasure...find yours 
My dude
He has been an icon on the boardwalk for years. Such an inspiration  to health and exercise,  well being. Love him!
Yep! That sounds like him.
He'll be called the bike Doctor.

Again, he's experiencing heaven.
It doesn't matter if he was an all day worker, or the "master" asked him to start working at 5pm.
What's important is that he heard the call and he got there. Sure, his situation may have better set him up for success than that of
others, but let's not assess the merits of what he's doing based on how difficult it was to get there. If we do, we're really missing the point or not paying attention to the message.
That's pretty cool Jessica Carrillo
Alan B Keech
Michele Eaves don't know if you saw or even heard his story before but he's always skating we've seen him last time we stayed there
I don't understand why people have to hate on this man! I have known this man due to growing up here at the beach! I think he's a good-hearted and positive person! He's doing what makes him happy just the same as I'm doing what makes me happy which is chasing after my goals and dreams! Material things mean nothing! I'm all about enjoying life and having fun! Song I'll keep doing what you're doing you're awesome!
Fayaz Ahmad Utman
Leonardo Zanatta Hélio Godoy Ramon Baffa Pinhata
That 'rat race' is what allowed him to make all that money and then do what he wanted. Without that "cashing it in", he wouldn't be skating now. Not much different than what every other rich/fortunate person does... makes enough money to finance whatever they want to do after they quit the rat race.
Charlotte DelGobbo!!
I can't remember either 
I've seen him doing his thing
That is sooooo cool

Amazing story. Never heard of him until we took a trip to SD from Boston. Was walking on Mission Beach a few times and heard people calling out "hey slomo" was curious so looked him up. Had the chance to actually talk to him for a few minutes. He videos what people think and what's on there mind as he did us. I am thinking there is more to See then meets the eye. GD guy

As a former skater, I totally get this! There's nothing like it!!
Pip Honour 
An amazing story.
Yeah.  He could afford too.  You're elitist crap sickens a coming revolution.
Exactly.   Right on!
Still, being so cheerful. He effectively has stopped this world and got off. I admire him for that. It is easily possible to do it without much money.

Love it!
Pretty good perception.
This is a non-story to me, but I'm glad to see it anyway. It's a lesson to not judge a book by it's cover. He may look homeless - he isn't, blah blah. He is not miraculous for doing this at the age many people retire in general. He can afford his lifestyle and is happy. Yay for him. But thanks for giving everyone a different lifestyle to look toward having in retirement, NYT! Maybe you will speak to someone in a rainy, mildewed state who is grossly depressed and miserable and they will be empowered to decide it's time to go skate themselves into golden oblivion.  I don't think there's much point to this otherwise.
Hi Slomo! You are living my dream! Hope you have a great day!

Kim Harris Crute here ya go
Actually please don't have a mid life crisis and actually turn into a weirdo like this dude
i just sometimes think it is our animal instinct to roam, not to be locked up inside the office, inside the studio or whatever place. It is an urge to be unchained. Other countries in Europe for example have different standards for society regarding labor and I just see them to be more happy than any of us here in the US. People in Japan overwork because it is what they think gives them to be more respected and eventually commit suicide because they cannot cope with all of the stress. I was once told to not work too hard, but to work smart, our fear just magnifies our obligations.
I'm not that aimless yet. I'm still 98% structured. Unfortunately...

Melissa Miller me too! I watched it while eating breakfast and getting reading this morning so I feel like I didn't give it my full attention so I'm going to watch it again tonight. I feel like many of us could learn a lot from Slomo.  I'm also really excited to hear his scientific explanation of why we like to accelerate again. It's cool to know there's an actual reason why that's so fun!
Zoey Lande Abby Hotaling Julia Leventhal This is the guy I was telling you about!

Ari Monterey That was very nice of you.  What you really wanted to say was Troll.  Bottom dwelling, usually evil and can suck the life out of every room the moment they step into it.
Pretty fantastic right? Hope you're doing well and killing grad school Franny!

Jen, I love that we are skating on our own boardwalk. I love you and our life together.
Emilie Merckling SLOMO!!!!!!
I will like to meet him!! I just return to my skates and I share his feelings about skating. Great story, great person!

Elizabeth Eckenrod
I haven't! But now I want to go on a hunt to see him hahaha
This guy has been freaking me out since '06. I've always just thought he was on acid.

Constanza mira!
Jared Dial
Spencer Peake
Haha  Marlon Rechberger
Dude... regardless of what you say about Slo-mo... it's awesome to see him in person every day at the beach. He's an inspiration regardless.  Sure, he worked hard to have the choice to live in Pacific Beach and do what he loves but he also left a life that many would rather continue living unhappily just to keep the status. Yes, he is a bit of a celebrity on the boardwalk nowadays, but I don't think that's what he's after... he just wants to be happy.

Kyler Evitt
Yeah, he didn't quit his job. He retired early. What a revelation.
Yeah follow your passion by either retiring early or, if you're still young, by not contributing to society and using services that others work to pay for. Cool.
j'en reviens pas, merci
This is so good.
How the hell is this story amazing? He retired early. If everyone followed the "do what you want" mantra, we wouldn't have any garbage pickup or a functioning sewage system, or hell, a functioning society. Hogwash.
Richard Layne
Nope, it isn't even giving it all up. It's just retiring early.
Exactly!
Melissa Rea Yes - all the locals knew his story & that short documentary u shared has been out for a few years so I saw it awhile back & it filled in the gaps of things I didn't know. Pretty cool story heh?

Ha that's awesome, we did see this guy!
Oh yes we do! I remember him when I first moved to SD 12 years ago! He's been doing this for a long time!

Edward clearly missed the whole point of the video. Let me help you 1) Money does not make you happy 2)Do what you want to 3) Live within your means.  I am sure I am missing some things but this about sums it up.
Dear Marta van Horik.....you miss the mark. I'm still working and do what I am passionate about. There are many wise young people who know how to work and follow their passions. So what if the doctor was blessed with the ability to go to school many years, work hard and retire early.....he deserves it. He knows when to safely quit due to his loss of eye sight.....great service to his patients. I work in Retina and see many eye diseases and people who find it hard to give up their independence like driving. I raised 3 son's who are exceptional young men, college and graduate school. You bet they contribute to society in outstanding ways! I don't think Slomo  promoted irresponsibility.

You can only do this if you can afford to give up working for the rest of your life. As for divinity, it can also be found in the healing arts, in alleviating suffering; after all we're part of a greater whole that includes humanity. Slomo wants to stay high. Fine, just not necessarily a role model of wisdom.
Christian Aguinaldo

Kiko Lamb
Bester Mann!
I've known this guy for years because that boardwalk in Pacific Beach was where I would walk after work many nights and always be there on the weekend. He is so fortunate and blessed he could walk away from his job because he had the money to do it. Most people can't quit because they wouldn't be able to afford their rent or their new skates. The bottom line  is he's VERY fortunate he was able to walk away from his job, most of us would love to do that but can't! #blessed #lucky

Tony Boyer Sergio Villarroel
I know, I thought the same thing! I wonder how they picked up the story?!

You don't have to believe it. That doesn't mean it's not true. Maybe you could do a little research? You know, educate yourself.

Degree doesn't equate to intelligence fool
I'm guessing that's not a pharmacology doctorate you're working on

The recent study big pharma used to estimate its costs was funded by big pharama, was not peer reviewed, and used some questionable practices that have been called out as such in past studies. Link below.

It may take some effort, but the million dollars is a ruse to justify predatory pricing.
I think he’ll be glad we came across this and shared with him.
Joni, it does happen. Look up endocyte pharma company and research out of Purdue university. Mereck gave 1 billion in investments to endocyte on a new cancer treatment drug. And it is still not yet approved by the FDA it is still in clinical trails. I know because my brother with his phd in biochemistry molecular genetics is an inventor his discovery was published back in 2002 and and is just now on the fast track of FDA approval. It does take millions and years for research. Do the research. It has to go through many phases to get approved

Good
I used to work at Novartis. People who work there routinely collect soil and biological samples wherever they go on vacation which goes into the screening process.  You need good biologic diversity to increase the success of your screening programs.  if you're going to do screening.       In my experience (having worked in pharma research for 20+ years), basic research takes place in academia and a more applied kind of research takes place in pharma companies.   The cost of bringing a drug to market increases exponentially as you move from basic screening to clinical trials in new chemical entity research.  Believe it or not, academic research is not nearly as costly (or as likely to result in an approved drug) as the more targeted kind of research real pharmaceutical labs do.
No one asked you to believe it.  However, I can assure you that for every drug that gets approved, there are 5 - 10 candidate molecules that enter into some form of animal or human testing.  And, as you move from academic lab to animal testing to human testing, costs skyrocket.  Now, if you'd like to volunteer to do the work rats do in pharma labs, I bet we could get that cost way down.....
Fascinating! Thank you. 
Joni McReynolds so what?  You're a doctoral student?  Of what?  Most of the people on this thread actually are pretty highly educated, so trying to one up somebody here on that basis doesn't work.  t I've actually done pharma research, academically and for a company for over 20 years, as well as  raised funds in order to develop products   You don't sound like you've done that, because if you did, you'd know better than to make ill conceived statements based on your "beliefs".
She works at Thompson Rivers University.
be careful. Monsanto might find the cave and spray it.
tree nut skins are best source of antibiotic. Big pharma tried to ban trees every day. Watch the west burn.
Guitars matter less than ever according to whom?
another out of touch article that no one wants to read.
where's my girl Mitski
But you  felt the need to comment on.
I'm pretty sure Diarrhea Planet would disagree with that statement
War On Women  
Makoko Seita it was a question, not a statement
Girls Rock! Indianapolis
Us mandolin pickers rely on guitarists to back us up. Also, guitarists make great husbands and friends!
does this have anything to do with the fact that you are a male ?
Bring back the eagles
Guitars mean more now than they ever have.  Dont believe the hype.
Leanah Chestnut
Guitars Cadillacs and hillbilly music
It depends on the type of music you're making.  Guitars are important  to rock and country. If it's electro/dance then you may not need it. Except for live shows to make the experience  more intense for  the audience.  The same for hip hop. Guitars are still important today in live shows.
Did that first sentence in the description have any sort of factual basis or truth behind it? Maybe if you listen to one type of music then you don't care about guitars but to say they don't matter is ignoring the fact that millions of people listen to genres of music that use guitars in every song
Leena Erik
Will Krulak its the girl band you like
Snail Mail!
Perhaps look up what "may seem" means. As in it is a perception, especially based on the actions of Major Labels.
If these are the saviors, Rock is dead.
Pretentious

[pri-ten-shuh s]

adjective
1. Characterized by assumption of dignity or importance, especially when exaggerated or undeserved: a pretentious, self-important waiter.
2. Making an exaggerated outward show; ostentatious.
3. Full of pretense or pretension; having no factual basis; false.
Maybe it's not that guitars matter less than ever, but music critics are dumber than ever.
...may seem?  Wow - you had me at the start with "Guitars..."  and then went right over the cliff head first!  Lame.
Rock is dead.  It died with Kurt Cobain.  This stuff is just the funeral music...
http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100
http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100
The billboard top 100 has always been radio hits. Doesn't mean it's the only good music out there
Hummour !!!
that's not the point. no one is saying that good guitar-based songs are being made. but it is objectively true that they are much less popular than they used to be.
rock no longer has the same major influence on the direction of pop music or culture that it once did
F@ck guitars, I like my bands to be heavy in oboes.
ZERO relevance to guitars. NYT disappoints yet again.

I was click-baited by this because I expected to hear female bands "making some of the most urgent, politically relevant music around" with GUITARS.
Emily Foertsch you might find this interesting
I won't argue there, it's clear that what's popular now mostly uses computerized instrumentals rather than recorded instruments (for the most part)

But you can't just ignore that fact that there are people who don't just listen to what's popular. And to say guitars matter less isn't really accurate.

That being said, I honestly don't know what this nyt video/article even had to do with guitars...

Sorry, from one who experienced the music of the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's, music today is pathetically non-creative.

loooool this is so good! Also Snail Mail going for Songs Ohia lmao ...so hxc
I see a lot of you are still living in denial that rock is dead. I was there once, still clinging to the hope that it will come back and save the music scene from it's inevitable decline into creative mediocrity. You just have to accept it at this point. It's dead. It's never coming back to the mainstream, and that's ok. It was never supposed to be there in the first place. It has returned home to where it has always belonged; dingy bars, musty basements, and small venues. Take a deep breath and say it with me: Rock n Roll is dead.

Unsalted butter is fresher because salt is used as a preservative.
That is one hell of a cake :)

Brandon idk whats wrong with me but the title of the cake made me laugh instantly
Unless you are springing for artisan butter, I doubt you could taste it. Even then it's doubtful.

The point of a dump cake is that you just dump stuff into the dish you are baking it in.  You only dirty the baking dish.  When you use a double boiler, bowls, pots, strainer, etc. It is just a regular cake.

I bought some Amish made butter at our local bulk food store and it was very salty. But with commercial brands I can't tell the difference, and I am not a heavy salter.
Logan Grgs
I have to strongly disagree. I've made this cake, and I hated the 2-ingredient frosting. Nothing magical happens - it literally tastes like chocolate sour cream.

Well....Let me tell ya story. Back in 1899 when this recipe was invented, a lot of bakers lived very lonely lives. When the freshly baked cake was dumped out of the pan, the bakers would put their penises inside the cake to test for moisture and warmth.

Saman Ahmad Kulsoom Imdad Jini Jacob this is a good recipe. I didn't use the frosting in video though, & frosted with my almond and  walnut one. Went really well with it. Do try!
Why did the cake turn out dark? My Grand mem mem made this cake ninety one point one years ago and our alien dog grandpa loved it. But we never added sugar the way you did.

Make it vegan!

"Dairy is proving to be a vulnerable spot for the entire slaughter racket. The public is steadily waking up to the fact that the reality of milk production is not a matter of trivial imperfections, of concern only to idealist vegans, but in fact the most dark and wicked part of all farming. And delicious, non-dairy milk, cheese and dessert alternatives are now widely available, so as people learn the truth it is easy for them to ditch dairy for good."

Mmm

My understanding is that using unsalted butter not only controls the salt in the recipe, but also that the added salt in the butter interferes with the volume of the ultimate result of the recipe.  Cookies are not flat, etc when unsalted butter is used.
This looks even better than the last dump 
Edona Karakashi
How is that any different than adding a teaspoon of salt to the recipe?
Yes!!! This is just the right amount of choco

Not a true dump cake, but at least you dump most stuff into the same pot. It's still a little simpler than many cakes made in a mixer. I haven't made this yet and I wonder how well the ingredients blend this way. From the picture I can see some white/light spots which I suspect are lumps of flour that didn't blend in. Has anyone made this recipe? Does it work as well as in the video? It's not a new recipe.
Grasienta era la que hiciste aquella vez con 2 kg de mantecaaaa
No, people are baking a good chocolate cake all wrong. Butter, salt, milk, eggs and baking soda are horrible ingredients for a good chocolate cake and totally unnecessary for flavor, texture, or success at the table. Try a good eggless chocolate cake made with olive oil and water. Don't use baking soda. Use baking powder. Salt is ridiculous. The only ingredients that are absolute for flavor is the vanilla and, of course, the yummy, yummy cocoa. No heating on the stove waiting for the mixture to cool....waste of time.

Hint:  Instead of using flour to dust the pan, use cocoa powder.  It blends into the cake rather than leaving that flour residue on the cake after baking it.  No flour taste, just chocolate.

sure do boo! read some of these other comments tho...specifically "Well....Let me tell ya story. Back in 1899 when this recipe was invented, a lot of bakers lived very lonely lives. When the freshly baked cake was dumped out of the pan, the bakers would put their penises inside the cake to test for moisture and warmth."

Maybe he could design her a brain, class, and personality....?
The terrorist attack in London ! Six people were injured when spraying toxic substances in East London.
Melania tramp.
Eew.
LOL ouch!
Why are you doing an article on this person? Shame...
You do it so well.
So I assume he just copies what Michelle Obama's designer did then?
Liberals: Its wrong to bash women
Also liberals:
No, thanks.
His accent is utterly charming. No comment on the First Lady.
http://happy-foxie.com/so-you-still-support-trump-2/
Janym January He sounds very humble and I like his style
https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/graduate-studies-help/
Sure she outsources this too...no shock here. Nothing made in America is good enough for #45
Pure liberal hate.
great piece...thank you for just sticking to the art of it.  I can't begrudge an artist an opportunity.
So he must copy other designers then?
Just give her a g string and a pair of pasties..I mean,what more does a stripper need?
To be fair, all designers copy other artists but they iron out the flaws and make small improvements. This is evolution.
Hehe, he is French so it sounds nice. I feel his English is very good though and he is really a talented designer.
I understood Dan!! :-)
"that you work hard in life...that your vord ees your bond"

Miserable Melanija, hires a foreigner to dress her manly body 
Lipstick on a pig.
Yes!
I don't understand how people can't separate politics from fashion or any art. I'm super liberal and hate Trump, yet I have no issues appreciating this designer and some of the clothes Melania wears. I find her quite elegant and this has not been present in the White House since Jackie Kennedy. Things happen like a train on social media. It's like everyone following the same train with no individuality or personal thinking whatsoever. I know I'll get sh-t here, but I don't follow trains, only my own consciousness.
She has a nice femenine figure, I think you are talking about Bruce Jenner dressed up like a woman.
I love the French accent, always have.
Designing for a racist brother, sure it's fine with him as long as he gets paid.
She's been seen in less.
Is he responsible for the fluorescent pink dog blanket she wore to the UN?
Hahaha!
Pure Troll Response.
I hope he gets paid in advance....
Crystal Means..Once you have heard Yorkshire, you will never go back to french...  knocks em bandy every time..
Not interested
So thats where all those horrendously FUGLY clothes come from!!
Ameni Ben Amor
Well you probably right, however, First Lady is fashionable but being a First Lady that's a serious position she should be doing more to help, we haven't seen any achievements from her so far.. how do you explain that?
Undermining this designer's talent just because he designs for Melania Trump means that you would dare to undermine Shostakovich for composing for the Soviet Union. Do you realize how nonsensical that is? Let's keep politics separate from art, please.
Just go to Vegas and observe what all the hookers there are wearing.
Saturday nites and the Pains is usually a good place to go.
No thanks.
I'm a lover of accents in general. Having lived all over the world and speaking a few languages myself, I can appreciate those whose first language is not English.
Note to self. Bye Herve.
NOT interested!! Show me something that matters if you want me to remain a subscriber!!
Coco Chanel happily and profitably collaborated with the Nazis. Glad this creep could keep up the proud tradition.
He has a beautiful eye for fashion and design. His front door?! Just gorgeous.
I don't know - Ivanka has been wearing some pretty gawdy looking outfits lately.
Why?
No thanks.
Can't say I care for his designs. When she doesn't look frumpy, her clothes look too juvenile. Just my opinion. Politics aside. I do like some of her casual outfits, though.
Did he design the hot pink mess she wore at the UN?  I certainly hope not.
Didn't care for the shocking pink number she wore talking about bullying...
Did you mean conscience?
Piss off who cares
Sarah Chun This is seriously beautiful
Gee, I think Michelle had some great designs! Melania usually looks good...
I love seeing the inside of his apartment. Great stuff.
this guy didn''t design that outfit.
Who the hells cares..... WAKE Wake Up America
I want to say, the personal is the political. It seems opportunistic to design for someone and get paid by someone who is not representing the needs of the middle class or the rights of the underserved. So his art is great... how far will he go to have a patron who is not respectable?
Hugo Boss designed for the SS so sure let's just shut up about politics and focus on the shiny shiny
Tell me he didn't design that inflatable hot neon pink pepto bismal dress monstrosity!?
Sooooo Michelle was not "elegant" enough for you? Sit down.
Did he specify anywhere that he believed in what Trump's administration believed in?
who cares.
Well she speaks five languages and by all accounts is a very sweet and smart woman.  As for class... perhaps you should try to show a little...
And the horrible make up?
She can barely string together an intelligible sentence in ONE language, so who are you kidding here? I was born at night, lady, just not last night.

Super cool! Nazi's made clothing out of human skin as well in the death camps. Everyone has their calling...
Completely stupid statement...
I'll agree Milanias clothes look good, most of the time. So did Michelle Obama. But that U.N. monstrosity proto bismal inflatable dress? Come On! Ugliest dress EVER!
Does he design ensembles for her with easy access crotch areas so the Donald can easily grab her genitalia?????
Pete Harrison completely false and you know it. You're just a hater... sit down.
You can dress her up, but you still can't take her out.
First Lady ??? ... But She's Trump's 3rd Lady ... Ok I'm Confused !!!
Anthony James Stratis
Pete Harrison.....pathetic response. Bless your little heart.
Another classy response.  Bless your little heart.
As an artist, he should chose integrity over making a quick buck. Melania Trump along with her husband represent everything that's wrong with the United States.
Who cares...
Talk to Leni Riefenstahl.
I am sitting down, in a nice, comfy office chair. Also, what's more pathetic than my comment? You even getting uptight enough to comment on it derisively. Go do something better now. Dismissed.
Anastasia Kailis  Helene Kailis
Sara Alfaqeeh
I think Melania just buys expensive clothing -Jackie had style and so does Michelle.
She is by far the most sophisticated First Lady I've seen.  Perfectly dressed for every occasion.  Not sure if we are seeing the same person.
She could have offered hot air balloon rides in that thing.
Ali Satterwhite glad you like her style. I don't.
I wish he had discussed the challenges of designing for a person without a conscience or a discernible purpose. Which silhouette best complements a moral vacuum?
It must be difficult for a designer to pull inspiration from such a vacant individual.
Nobody gives a fuvk about this "artist" who is aiding and abetting this administration

Hunger games
This is an unfair comparison! Strippers have marketable skills!
Gotta love a craftsman.
So is he the one that designed that pink monstrosity she wore to the UN meeting. Hahahahahahaha.
Im designed for Melania
Not worth it, Herve, not worth it.
So The Devil doesn't wear Prada!
So he sold his soul to evil
I hope he get pay
I don't care for Trump but Herve inauguration dress was very nice and fitted Melania to a tee
phffffffffffffttt.
I really love this video. I dunno why so much of the focus of the title is on melania there is so much more happening
No
No one cares what Eva Braun wants.
his accent.... i love
maybe thats really all u need for ur big break, an exotic accent
Zat uuhh iz actuaelly egzatly whut I neeeed hoew deed you knoëw
and also a mole.
But certainly true of Chanel.
Shostakovich could compose for the state or not compose at all. This guy has options.
Lauren Anne Geiger no I didn't. Conscience is the sense of right and wrong, and in this case there is no right or wrong but personal preferences and leanings towards what others may see as right or wrong. I meant what I wrote, but because conscious is an adjective I should change it to consciousness. Conscious or consciousness means to be fully aware of or sensitive to something.
Well if the trump's can afford these designer clothes costing hundreds of thousands of dollars then where is their cancelled personal check for $1 million donation they promised to Hurricane victims? And why are they not paying their personal attorneys? Campaign donations from trump supporters are. Just asking.
It's a joy to see a man love his work so much.... Not a Trump fan, but the First Lady always looks lovely and is appropriately dressed.
Ugh! Why bother with this, NYTimes?
Sell out.
Do we care?
Edite, I agree....except I think Michelle Obama was alway chic and appropriately dressed.
No. Just no.
Javier A. Simbana I don't remember Michelle Obama doing much for the first 6-10 months either. I believe each woman in that position should be given time to flourish on their own. They either will or will not but I wouldn't judge her too soon. It looks like she's a lot more together than he is just by watching her.
Suzanne Murray
Nope!!!!!
Interesting!
We have much, much more important things to focus on
This is your example of elegance????
Not stupid
I'm sorry for him.
Amanda Lewis Louden I was expecting this comment and you didn't disappoint. I think elegance is innate. You either have it or you don't. I don't believe MO is very elegant. She wore some but just some good pieces in my book but that doesn't mean she's elegant. Michelle had a position that allowed her to display but elegance is something entirely different. Jackie Kennedy on the other hand had it, so does Melania.
Meanwhile Michelle Obama wore J Crew off the rack. Just sayin'.
Do not care for a lot of her clothes
I wonder if he designed the huge pink tent.
That's what I said. Totally.
Money talks, Edite.
Edite Haberman oh I get it now. Plastic surgery plus nude pics divided by being white equals elegance in your bizarre world.  also pretty sure Jackie would slap your face for mentioning her in the same sentence with Melania.
Michelle Obama rocked J. Crew & designer clothing for eight years.  She's intelligent, accomplished, poised, professional, well-spoken, compassionate & fun loving and continues to be the perfect role model for girls & women around the world.  She's not a gold digger & never posed nude, so there's that too.
Jill Stein "elegant" enough for you? 
Jane Morrison what does that have to do with being innately elegant? You're confusing the point. But then again, you either see the point or you don't.
You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear and you can't make a first lady out of a pornstar.
Amanda Lewis Louden what does plastic surgery and nude pics have to do with fashion or elegance for that matter? I wouldn't be quick to judge other's worlds when you have no idea what they are. But like I posted you either see it (elegance) or you don't. Again that was part of my point in my original post, the fact that people can't separate politics from fashion. And you're not any different.
The irony is does our maniac baby #45 realize that he is surrounded (literally) by immigrants including the one he calls his current and former wives? I can't stand #45 and his mail order bride but can't and won't blame this designer for sticking to his job.. after all he is an artist and an immigrant. Now Melanie lovers, I'm waiting for your cry with "but he stole our jobs"? Bring it on and make my day pleaseeeeee 
Who cares
Just hope your work permit is up-to-date.
Amanda Lewis Louden actually Jill Stein in her mature age and usually wearing the same stuff, exudes an elegance that most women politicians don't have. But we were talking about First Ladies, remember?
He designed for her as well. And other First Ladies, but not under his own name. Watch and read what's written in the story.
Lol I liked your comment till you said Jackie. Can't help but to think of a race issue because Michelle Obama is one of the highest educated and definitely fashionable than the most former First Ladies.
it's okay... after this, no one will want to work with him...
Melania and Caitlin Jenner look exactly alike.
I do not give one iota about her designer.  I do not care about her clothes or shoes. I care about her politics.
Conscience* dipshit

She always looks the same.
Laura Melillo I can see you have none (conscience). But here's a copy of what I replied to someone else: Conscience is the sense of right and wrong, and in this case there is no right or wrong but personal preferences and leanings towards what others may see as right or wrong. I meant what I wrote, but because conscious is an adjective I should change it to consciousness. Conscious or consciousness means to be fully aware of or sensitive to something.
Clearly he didn’t design any of those for you.
'elegant' is a matter of opinion, it looks like.  I don't see it in Melania at all.
Who cares?
Anu Erdenebileg my post was about not being able to separate politics from fashion. Who I think is elegant or not has nothing to do with politics,  or race, but you wouldn't understand it. You see things from a different filter. Race has no bearings in my opinion here.
He needs to be on Project Runway...
I like the way she dresses.  Very classy.
He's a terrible designer. He'd be off of Project Runway by the first week.
Great comment
Pretty sure Marie antoinette's designer was French too
Coco Chanel had an affair!! She wasn't working for the Nazis.
Did you see that ridiculous Pink Dress she had on?
Yup, a lot of folk said that about the Nazis favourite artists too.
Nice article.
He's not writting propaganda..he's designing gowns! 
http://happy-foxie.com/can-you-spot-the-difference/
There's a word for this, collaborator.
Kim Norris how so? It is completely accurate.
You can put a designer dress on a pig, doesn't change the fact that it is still a pig.
Not true Michelle was not a classy lady her clothes l would not wear
Edite Haberman yeah sure it doesn't. "Edite"
The designer for our very own Eva Braun.
Julie Gittens every ones not a winner....but most of the time she looks lovely.
So..he's a creep because he's a fashion designer who got an opportunity to design clothes...not write speeches...just design clothes for the First Lady? That's a huge opportunity no matter who is in the position. I personally don't like someone on his list of past clients...and I'm not a fan of Melania either but this is a story about fashion. About this man and the cool opportunities he has been given and how he can separate politics from the situation and not completely hate a person for disagreeing with them...which is something that it seems like lots of people need to think about these days
I personally just love attire she wore while hosting kids in WH garden. Nothing like digging dirt in 400$ jeans and wiping forehead sweat on expensive plaid shirt. #goals
Au contraire mon soeur. She was a Nazi agent, confirmed by Vichy and Nazi documents.
Marcin Kupidura u got that right.
Cough.... racist .... Cough cough
I would think being associated with this administration would HURT his prospects.

Well said 
Robin Park he condoned it when he took their money, designed clothes & associates his name with them.
Franny Drayton You put your money where your mouth is. He's part of creating Trump's image, and Trump represents hate. I like a lot of art, music, etc created by awful human beings. I can separate the work from the person. I don't know enough about fashion to say if his work is any good but as a person, he's a creep.
Edite Haberman 
Apparently you think posing nude makes one elegant.... to me it's trashy
The Trumps, divorce, single parenting, welfare, social justice crap, the Obamas, this weird mix of socialism and capitalism we have going on when we really need pure capitalism, a screwed up generation thinking things that are not okay are, social media obsession, weird obsession with Hollywood, hollywood not having intellectual diversity, college campuses wanting to BAND and PUNISH intellectual diversity, letting people be unhealthy or do unhealthy things and propping it up as good to push an agenda, LACK OF PRIDE AND PATRIOTISM, and probably more that I can't think of right now also represent everything wrong with this great country at the moment.
Fuchsia P. Llewkcots so much ignorance.
I guess any clothing on this woman is an improvement.
Oh who the hell cares
Carrie Ann Navoy I haven't seen Melania posing nude since she's First Lady. But that's not what my post is about. It is in fact about not being able to separate politics from fashion. And here's an example.
Archie Gonzales , guess the time is here for your name to get known 
Omfg...
Herve Pierre the Inaugural Ball gown was lovely, and some of your other dresses were, too, in my opinion. But for the largest part, bombs.
NOT THE FIRST LADY.... SHE IS THE THIRD ESCORT GOLD DIGGER OF THE ORANGE TRAITOR FOR USA
Kim Norris It is not classy to demonize the standing president accusing him of not being born in this country especially when she worked in this country illegally and should have not been allowed to become a citizen. https://youtu.be/sSTx1ZODEcQ
https://youtu.be/sSTx1ZODEcQ
If you study the fashiom history, you would know it is not possible. Plus, learn some stories about Coco Chanel after WWII
Jason Snyder He actually isn't creating Trump's image - he IS designing CLOTHES FOR TRUMP'S wife!!!
Tracy Boone Her clothes are part of his image, just as Jackie's were part of JFKs.
Tsubasa KinLing Leung what's not possible. I'm aware of some of Coco Chanel's history. What's your point?
She has some beautiful clothes, but Herve Pierre, please no more blowsy bubble creations for her.  They make her look like a strong gust of wind could pick her up and blow her away!
Is it made in America???
Look who's talking?
Is thIs the guy who designed or chose that crazy pink dress she wore when speaking at the UN?
Bizarre
Mary Demirtchian
You sure you're talking about Melania and not her husband?
She does dress elegantly, JUST like JK.  Michelle was elegant and current but gashion is irrelevant to the quality of a First Lady.  She has cost 6 months at $500,000/ day for security on tax payers, picked cyber bullying is her focus (a clear fail so far), and she posed as a nude model in earlier years.  I do not see how materialistic is an example of leadership or elegance.
Melania was a fashion model. She certainly wears clothes well... Although, I actually haven't been overly impressed with her "look" since she has been first lady. Now... Fashion is art and that is totally subjective...I admit this. 
I think "elegance" is a completely different thing. That is an internal reflection of your inner grace and character, manners and stylishness. I think Melania doesn't quite meet my criteria of excellence. I think she wears clothes well, but lacks confidence that's based on empathy. I guess to me she seems... Sad and a little damaged. Just my opinion.
Well, I'm not seeing any elegance from you, Edite. I'm just going to consider the source and say pffffffft.
Don't forget she was a gold digger, who married a rich old man, so let us see, a pole dancer, soft porn actress, nude model, gold digger? Wow that is just the example of class, and grace i want to instill in my daughters. I would have more respect for her if she still did soft porn, and nude pics. At least she was being honest.
OMG the pink curtains <3
I still think he shouldn’t work for her. I understand every artist’s wish for a unique opportunity like that, I really do. However, there is something more important than an opportunity. It is the message you send by grabbing it. About who you are, what your price is, the ideals you stand for. It shouldn’t be the wrong ones. They are part of an artist’s legacy as well, you know...
Edite Haberman You 'haven't seen her posing nude since she's been the First Lady'??  She just became first 'lady' - give her time! 
Kiley Blackman I just hope it is not in the kremlin
Lindsay - interesting watch
Nobody is bashing Melania because she is a woman. They are bashing her for enabling the amoral idiot in the White House.
I have nothing against Melania but this article proves just how much of an empty dress she is.
Yeah, I never appreciated that sugar-daddy loving porn star look for our flotus' either 
He's adorable. I'm happy for him.
Anna Russo I feel sorry for a lot of the people here
We all sell our souls in a Faustian Bargain for fame and fortune.
Ali Satterwhite Clearly not.  The outfit she wore to the UN was hideous.  She is no more sophisticated than any other First Lady.  Even in expensive clothes she doesn't look classy somehow.  Agree with OP about her casual outfits though.
Who cares....
All the NYT articles on my feed for the past few weeks are about obnoxious rich people.
How can you design for a woman that posed naked for men's magazines?
Is he the one responsible for the bright pink puffy balloon thing she was wearing while giving a speech?? That thing was UGLY! And it made it look like her head was tiny.
Helene Kailis
Edite Haberman 
You know what was elegant about Jackie O?  She had knowledge of history , art,  spoke many languages and was highly educated.   

And she also didn't go around sporting a FLOTUS hat that you can buy online to fill her pockets. 

Imagine any other First Lady posing nude to make money?
What politics?
You can if you have enough money.
Millie Spataro I suppose the world seeing Melania's shaven crotch is classy.
Is she the only Customer ?
Carrie Ann Navoy actually Jackie O. also married for money when she married Onassis. And yes, she was cultured.
With all that is happening....  Who cares?????
Thumbs down  don’t care
If only.....
Edite Haberman she married to get away from the American society who killed her husband... and she wanted to raise her kids in private.  She also had a real job as an editor after her husband was murdered.  Keep trying to compare them. 

Trump is Camelot right?
He has 2 interns working for him lol
Make sure they pay you in cash buddy.
I DONT CARE
Eliza Durzynska Mariola Krawiec
That would be nice.
Like anyone remembers what she wore.
WHO CARES??!!
Cool. Hugo Boss made SS uniforms.
Shame on you Hervé Pierre! You need to be boycotted!
Don't you just love those smart vintage Hugo Boss SS uniforms!?
Alex Coffield !!!!
Perhaps this designer doesn't share your opinion of the Trumps. He should be able to work for whomever he pleases without answering to you.
Tee.
I would think no one cares what you think!
We should crowd fund a guillotine lol
Yesss!
I think he only grabs women he's not married to....
Twanna Bivins, any idea who did? She looked like the strawberry version of the Stay-Puft Marshmallow man.
She's a birther.
I only pay attention to designers who WON'T work for Melania. She needs to be deported, and she has incredibly tacky clothing. Also lied about having a degree. Sad.
he is dressing a nazi
u need meds

I'm glad she has taken to wearing clothing as 1st Lady.
Marie-Emmanuelle Porlier It was a joke not an assertion. Chill.
Millie Spataro Class comes from actions and words, not clothes. 

Explain how Michelle Obama was not classy, if you would please?

Hard pass.
Carrie Ann Navoy yes all of that, AND she didn't want to worry ever about money. Or you don't see that? And who's comparing?
Scott Barrett for somebody who thinks that silence equals death, that will need meds!
He certainly has had a wonderful opportunity to design for a lady with elegant taste.
Wafa

some of the comments here are unbelievable!  Are Americans on the whole so mean? This is a talented man who can make his name as a fashion designer in your country.
Julie Gittens she was a known Nazi collaborator   and supported the Vichy regime. 

Its not just the affair you saw in the Audrey Tatou movie.
Michele was elegant. Or are you describing just the white women?
    Elegance and colluding with fascism, don't go together for me. Like her husband, she just seems like trash with money.
Can he design class?
I hope he didn't need to get paid.
Interesting... good for him
Millie Spataro His customers are first ladies.  High end.  Yet you think one first lady is ok and another is not classy?
Dolma Beck here we go again.  No, I don't think Michelle was elegant. She had a platform that allowed her to display herself with some good pieces of clothes, but that is not enough to make anybody elegant. Does that have  anything to do with race? Of course not! Respect others' opinions and don't entangle them with your own prejudices. My post was exactly about the fact that most can't separate politics from fashion. You're a perfect example. Live and let live.
Well said!
Beauty is growing from inside, not outside! Have you read poem before? Try to appreciate the beauty through the quality of the person, not just a style or dress!
Thomas Ryan
It sounded like he also acts as stylist, and helps her pick out clothing by other designers, as well as designing for her?
Yes, indeed , agree . I hate Trump sooo much , cant express how much- but Melania has taste and style for fashion.( exept her  pink parachute pink dress ) and beautiful body. I am saying this , not bcs I am Slovene , but bcs its truth!
No.....nonono....not interesting...
Never heard of him
Yeah, never heard of him, everyone around me works in fashion, in the capital of fashion too, he's French, yet, I'm very certain none of them know this guy exists. So, his name being talked about by everyone!? Honey, no!
Elias Tsavoussis
Probably the reason why it was so last min was because all the other famous designers didn't want to make a dress for her so he was the last resort.
This poor man needed the money. His whole speech is defensive. Had he not needed  the money, he nearly alludes that he would never have done it.
Your First Lady (and I use that term very loosely), is here in Canada right now.   Yuck!

What a sad piece of propoganda... fashion isnt class...Mrs Obama can wear something from KMart and look elegant; Mrs Trump V3 can have designer outfits and look like someone who married a very cruel man for money. Of course sge is not but sge would look similar to what one might imagine when thinking of a gild digger.
Since Jackie Kennedy?!?! lmao!!!!  More fail than fashion!!!!


That would be even more of a tragedy.
David Kerry Beswick I don't agree. When MO wears something from Kmart or J Crew, she looks like someone who wears something from Kmart or J Crew. Yes, fashion isn't class, but we're discussing fashion. I'm not in the mood to start discussing who has class and who doesn't, that's also very relative but it's not the topic here.
I didn't know she had started wearing clothes . ( LADY)
His apartment is fantastique!
Rita Val - guarda che casa.. caminetto e porta sono decorati con il cartone 
Juana Calderon Vela.
Fascinating
Trump is concerned with protecting national sovereignty.   That means having lots of Legal immigrants while keeping illegal aliens out
He is a delightful person, and his job is being a designer. He does not make policy. I can separate.
Who cares?  I'd rather you interview her English tutor.
Quentin Geczy
Well Hugo Boss designed the Nazi uniforms!!!
Did he make that horrendous pink puffy blouse she wore last week? 
I couldn't care less for Melania, she does nothing for the nation. Also, her price tag sticks out clearly.
Mallory Adams

Zzzzzzz
Casey Wolfe Walk interesting piece on fashion!
Let them eat cake.
They must pay him a lot of money because I can't see too many other people ready to do it
Edite Haberman you can slap a designer outfit on a pig doesn't change the fact that it is a pig.   That being said your taste in fashion and elegance sucks the big one.    Of course that is my opinion.
There goes his business.
Mike Romano you have a French twin!!
Maybe he could design her a husband who isn't a racist.
Gabriëlla Candice Esser
Kim Norris There is very little evidence that she has anything other than a rudimentary grasp of five languages. IOW, she, like her husband, lies a lot.

http://americablog.com/2017/08/melania-trump-really-fluent-french-italian.html
Poor guy
So much bigotry from the liberal left. He's a designer, people, not a politician nor a humanitarian worker. And to him, she's a client. I really don't understand why you need to turn everything into nonsense in order to defend your own agendas, can't find a more clever way, eh?
Kathleen McGuire Pettineo Betty Ardaya McGuire Philip McGuire check out 1:26 or so.
I agree with you Edite Haberman regarding separating fashion from politics.
But I think he has more hair and not enough gray in his beard!
Jean Mazgaj Bjorn Melania was a center fold pin up model who lied about a college degree and stole someone else's speech no comparison to any other first lady ever... Let alone a two degree Ivy league graduate like Michelle Obama or Jackie Kennedy. I'm appalled that people even compare her to Jackie O it's an insult to Jackie O.
C
Is he the guy who designs those poofy sleeve dresses she wears? Make those sleeves as poofy as possible please!!
Nice
Guess you missed it. The Trumps million dollar donation to Hurricane Harvey victims has been made and verified by the recipients. Don't know about attorney fees, have to wait for facts. http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/350999-trump-makes-good-on-pledge-to-donate-to-harvey-relief

Impossible, as the designer says, to "separate the political whatever" from these unprecedented times. The only people who can do that are people who are certain they will not be touched.

Migdalia Serrano-Smith  I can't find my comment, but know I am confused by many comments.  Someone talked about Michelle Obama slouching.  I googled and found no pictures to support that.  A friend of ours said Mrs. Obama wore burlap.   I never saw that either.  People protect themselves with thinking errors.  They cannot accept that we had a strong independent women for a first lady that made her way intellectually and morally.
She is one elegant lady and her clothes are so beautiful!
Screw anyone that profits by helping this mad despot and his minions.

This debate is ok to have, but certainly not relevant to a First Lady's legacy.
Each of our modern First Ladies have had their own style and what they were comfortable wearing.
Some were attractive, some not.  In the end, what was their legacy...Jackie transformed the WH with renovation, and elevating the arts.  The Bushes, Barabara and Laura pushed for literacy, Lady Bird, beautification of public places, Nancy Reagan...just say no, Betty Ford..breast cancer awareness..Hillary, health care, Michelle healthy eating/living and elevating girl's self esteem and who can forget Eleanor Roosevelt...most influential of any modern FL. Her causes too numerous to mention.
Melania may be model perfect in designer clothes, but let's wait to see where her platform of cyber bullying lands and what she does to make it an effective one.

Escort chic - a new genre.
The hot pink outit was a definite mistake:  made her look sallow.

He should have saved himself some time and sent a trash bag.
You can put trash in a designer bag and it’ll still be trash.
I Love this guy, great attitude and passion for what he does.  It's so ironic to see the comments of all of these liberals saying how he shouldn't design for the first lady because of their political BS, then you all are the neo Nazis  not Trump.  We live in a democracy and if this guy wants to design for whoever he wants to, it's his choice that's why we're in the U.S. we have freedom!!   Americans don't like your BS you're pulling because you didn't get your way, grow up!!  If you keep this up he will be re-elected in 2020!!
I would say she looks good, not lovely. Nothing to love about her. People might feel sorry for that woman, but since I saw her having the gall to question Obama's citizenship while she herself was an illegal immigrant, I can't even pity her for ending up with that mental husband of her.

Fashion is politics bc it alters the image of a person
Wonder if he designed that Pepto-Bismol pink horror she wore to the UN???
The shirt was 1000$!!!!!!!!!!
Couldn't care less
Actually 1380$ to be exact. Dollar up or down, who cares! Smh
Art is the medium through which we communicate our worldview and our message. It can never be separated from politics because politics is your worldview,  your actions, and their effects on the world.
So you are saying illegal immigrants are threatening our nation's sovereignty? And having a lots of legal immigrants (where are they?) will assure this so called compromised sovereignty while he is trying hard to implement policies to keep out any immigration at all and supporting white only movements? You need to try harder to convince me. Coming from a hard working immigrant who sacrificed so much to be an American. You and your president insults everything we dedicated to this country and making us question our decisions.
Like 45 keeps the politics out of football.
No matter who he designs for...his creativity and passion for his fashion designs is evident and inspiring. LOVE his apartment/design studio!!!
Michael Blumenauer Favor LMAO they REALLY should include some of the First Porn Star's earlier works in these articles - maybe along with tDump's purchase order for her

Edite Haberman can I just ask why you don't think Michelle is elegant? Curious...
Tellement inspiré par ce qu'il propose au monde sans se prendre au serieux une seule seconde. Admirable. Sa manière d'être me rappelle Fabrice Luccini.
Síne Creamer - I thought of you when I saw this. Very interesting.
A wonderful video of a brilliant artist!
No thanks.

He won't get paid lol
No thanks.
Amanda Lewis Louden exactly. We  all (on our end here) thought Michelle's style was exquisite. Not sure what these people are talking about "not existent  in WH since Jackie". Get real people or perhaps learn elegance and speak its language.
Edite Haberman right. We are all impressed by your thoughts.
Kim Norris speaks 5 Languages and you know that. Thanks for the enlightenment. We don't care.
Since Jackie Kennedy? Are you serious? Nancy Reagan and Michelle Obama were some of the most elegant ones. But that's my opinion ofcourse.
What a waste of his time and talent ...
She says it's not a race thing but gives no reason why Michelle wouldn't be considered elegant in her eyes.
we need more people like you, anu, to enrich the discourse!
Not interested
Olivia Lowry it was obvious that you were looking for blood with your charged question but I took the time to answer it any way and I did that clearly and plentifully. So since you didn't get the ammunition you were looking for, you're starting it yourself. Thats pathetic and expected. Are you happy?
Who cares!
Clothes have been elegant, beautiful and so stylish. Congratulations to you, on a job well done!  I think Melania looks stunning in every venue.  I'm a very big fan!
No thank you.
Edite Haberman You have to be kidding! Melanie is a model by profession. (Lots of models have their own style-not her). They dress her. Michelle has her own style. Granted I didn't always like what she wore but she didn't copy. Melanie copied Jackie O give me a break!
Kim Norris Really! She barely has any college education. Why haven't we heard of her use of language skills? Won't touch class with a ten foot pole-her resume speaks for itself.
Ali Satterwhite seriously?? Check her background. Phony is putting in nicely!
Hope he is getting paid
Helen Crawford first its Melania, not Melanie. Second we all know she's a model. Yet there are models who are not very elegant outside of the runway. And even when they dress them, they either have an innate elegance or they don't. And if you read my answer to someone else as to why I think she has style and other First Ladies like Michelle Obama don't, that's what I think. I'm also a designer so my opinion is not emotional or politically biased. It's outstanding how people get hang up on the Obamas. My post was not about them but about the article in the NYT about Hervé Pierre. And that's that!
Bump
Jackie Kennedy wore outrageously expensive French couture; after being criticized for that, she started buying clothing by Oleg Cassini....
Michelle Obama also wore expensive couture. All "First Ladies" do.....except Mrs. Carter! Geez.

Fashion can not be totally uncoupled from politics, on many levels. Where we put out attention and what our priorities are, for two. Just take the movements against fur a few decades ago.
Daniel Carr I get what you're saying, and it makes sense in your example of the movements against fur because that includes the abuse and killing of innocent animals. But fashion in the case I was making is pure style and design. There are no political consequences. You could say that perhaps the amount of money they spend is political. I don't know if Melania's clothes are paid for by her and Trump or by us, but they all spent our money. From Michelle Obama and her constant vacations and outlandish excursions and wardrobes, to Jackie Kennedy redecorating and revamping the White House and each of them had their way of spending our money. So I hope people here will not start now nickel-ing and dime-ing with those comparisons. Yes, I know about the D&G flower coat that Melania wore in Europe that sells for 10k. I wish I could afford that amazing piece.
rude much?

Yes.. he is a great designer.

"..the Monarchical, the Aristocratic, and the Democratic...The three good ones are those which we have just named; the three bad ones result from the degradation of the other three, and each of them resembles its corresponding original, so that the transition from the one to the other is very easy" (The Prince, Machiavelli, p111)

Communism should be considered as an added state because it would establish equality, stability, and while it should also be considered for all levels of society, it will help the lowest level the most to survive and eventually thrive.

Political systems need to be free flowing, constantly moving or not staying still for prolonged periods of time in order for corruption to not exist and for inevitable means of profit to arise.

"Thus sagacious legislators, knowing the vices of each of these systems of government by themselves, have chosen one that should partake of all of them, judging that to be the most stable and solid. In fact, when there is COMBINED under the same constitution a prince, a nobility, and power of the people, then these three powers will watch and keep each other reciprocally in check" (The Prince, Machiavelli, p 115)
What are you trying to communicate? I like Machiavelli as well but learning must be applied and comprehended not just repeating empty sentences.

I think a better bet would be to try to breed more adaptable coral polyps--because there may well come a time when the new breeds will have to face still other conditions--and if all of them are exclusively heat and acid resistant, the whole process will have to be undergone again.

Perhaps reserves for other breeds in cooled, acid-free pools, against future need?
This is cool Fernando Gonzales

People like you get on my nerves. Just because you haven’t seen it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Anytime someone tells their truth, someone like you has to come in trying act like it’s a one off occurrence . It happens all the time in Germany. It’s talked about a lot and that’s why they felt the need to do a documentary in the first place.

The earth does belong to everyone, that’s why you weren’t born on a boat. The resources of a country that took hard work and sacrifice to achieve does not belong to everybody, which is also what you are asking for.
Disgusting and disappointing that people can be this hateful. Apparently the world still hasn't learned from all the devastation of the 20th and 21st centuries.
Thankfully I won't be alive to see the downfall of Europe.
Huge mistake to bring in so many refugees.
2.000.000 ??? Why do u even lie about numbers? Is it for showing the case more dramatic?  It's not even close to million.

Tini Heudorfer Kuhn do YOU live in Saxony? Better yet, you’re not black nor a refugee? So how would you experience it in the first place? Do you even personally know any black people at all? 

All you have to do is research the way black people in Germany feel about the country and what they experience on a daily basis. 

This documentary was showing the truth. Stop trying to downplay it and act like it doesn’t exist.
Because you don't have to live in Germany to understand that this happens everywhere. White people in America say hate crimes don't exist because they don't experience them. Just because you don't experience it or see it doesn't mean it's not happening.
2 million? Total disaster.
Wash your mouth
Tini Heudorfer Kuhn not to mention, me living there has nothing to do with the situation. He told his truth and you’re trying to downplay it. Nice try but nope, we’re not gonna deflect from the situation at hand.
You got your numbers wrong. It wasn't even a million refugees. I'm sorry how he gets treated here.
Collapse of Europe.
She's not saying it's not happening. She's saying that there are lots of different, in fact positive examples. Same holds true for my experiences as well. So don't judge that way. No one is playing anything down over here. We are well aware of problems like that and the vast majority is working on making them vanish
This is exactly why education needs to be accessible. This young man is in the prime of his life and yet has no future, no direction, nothing to give him hope. He was engaged with the theater troupe, but what else? what else can he do in his day to day? As a teen were i to live at a refugee shelter with no hope or way out I'd be frustrated, angry and depressed. 

The question of refugees is how to we help integrate them and help them develop skills to become productive members of society?
I don't think they were trying to downplay it but sure go ahead
I will tell you why Europeans are tired of refugees... 1. they welcomed them but then realized they don’t have the resources to sustain “the invasion” that it has truly become. 2. The “refugees” brought a culture that does not jibe with the west.. women are seen as objects, rapes have doubled ( look at Italy and Sweden) and Europeans are not used to having to deal with this 3. They have brought a different religion ( Islam) that has started a culture war. Europeans are tired of having to adjust their lifestyle to a “guest”s demand that Europe change its way of life to match Islam’s demands. 4. Many Refugees say they want and seek freedom, but really they just want to bring their old way of life to a new country. 
So, there you go. If you can’t assimilate, if you continue to want to be separate, do you really think you will be accepted with open arms?
My country, Italy has been changed drastically after the invasion of millions of refugees. And not in a positive manner. It is not sustainable growth.
We just can. Believe me. This will not bring anything down here.
Wow, and there I thought that Germany was an overall progressive country.
For those that think Shakespeare is for elites... Thank you Abode! You really know how to embody and feature humanistic ideas.
Auw very painful
So can I say in a nutshell, US does all these interventions all around the world, causing refugees to flow to Europe without helping to take them and then a US media is poking om Europe whose obviously do more for the refugees. Way the go!
I'm not sure if you've ever talked to a refugee or a black person in a suburb of Dresden, but it's much more than just a little exception.  Hoyerswerda, Bautzen, Freital, not to mention PEGIDA every monday... but sure, these are just some isolated incidents, Germany's not really like that!
Yes, a I know a lot. Actually I lived four years in the US. In the summer we had an African American girl visiting us. She travelled thru Europe with my daughter and had the best time
There are lots of incidences like this. Somehow,  the authorities, do not react and try to hide it. Strange.
Tyler Findlay
Kristen is right! Y'all Germans need to look past your nationalistic pride and admit you have a serious problem in your country
The problem is that this is how these kids get radicalized. No one helps, they are not educated and they see no way out of their misery.
What does he have to go back to? Poverty and death?
We must stop our wars.  Such will make it easier to deal with climate refugees.
I'd like to know why their Muslim brothers don't help them, all those rich countries like Saudi Arabia, Katar, The Emirates .... why aren't they welcomed in those countries?
Im sure and have seen That it is true in a lot of cases, some Germans have that fear and some ignorant people this terrible  hate but we need to be positive and overcome this. I want Germany to succeed. We need to become one and proof the critics wrong. I send love and prayers to everyone who is involved in this gigantic task. I'm proud of the humanity our chancellor showed at that time when all the others closed their doors/ borders . The haters will become the losers in history
Bree Keogh watch this it's a really interesting story
cc: Jim Driscoll: Here is a bit of data on the refugees in Germany .. almost 2 million arrived in 2015.
Not everyone in Germany thinks like that!! ... there are many of us how are doing everything they can against racism and neo-nazis! And there are still a lot of voluntaries, working really hard to help refugees settle here, to give them a safe new home. We welcome the once in need.
Ok so the Germans are fighting back against the raping and pillaging so now it's their fault. We've heard this before and just like always the Saul alinski tactics backfires.
Tini Heudorfer Kuhn oh ok, I knew a girl once who had fun in Europe, so all this stuff is overblown... that's the argument you're making here
If Germany were that bad I wonder what all those Americans are doing over here as we speak drinking all our beer at the German Oktoberfest.....where people from all over the world meet to party peacefully.
Jochen Breunig maybe you should read about your country's problems since mass men have migrated. The number of violence towards women Jews and homosexuals has risen.
I'd go anywhere but freaking Germany 
Tini Heudorfer Kuhn whopdedoo for you. You know one black person. Living in the us means nothing. I’m from the us and there are people there who never bother to come into contact with people different from themselves. 

That doesn’t change the fact the there is a problem with racism in Germany. And this young man’s story is not rare or unique.
Why are people so enraged at others for fleeing a country that was being bombed to pieces?! They haven't got choices. 
Why is there no compassion?
Which German channels are showing these videos, when and why? On the eve of a scary election that may well see Fascists in the German parliament for the second time, it seems extremely irresponsible to be sharing them.
I hope the far right's power in germany is a figment of imaginations of the media and the alt right nazis in the US....I hope the election goes differently than predicted...It did in FRANCE
Oscar Jesus, have you ever been in Germany? Why do you criticize a country you don't know. Besides there are many poor Germans who feel that their government doesn't do enough for them.
Kyle Vigraham exactly. I’m having a good time living in London but that doesn’t erase some of the stuff that goes in here. 
Do not share!
This is the country of the the Holocaust. Did people think that that embedded hate really went away? Just as if you were born to parents with mental issues, you may have them too. A countries past holds a generational curse.
It was less than a million... and the country is quite big...but Germany sure has some problems, and had before
Europe and US has to abolish once and for all racism, Nazism, narcism and fascism!
There's no reason save money to go to Germany if racism is so rampant there. If you want to get the big welfare, then you just have to live with the so called racism. Easy as.
Benedikt Hirmer
William Stowe So do we Americans.
I feel for him because his hopelessness and his anger are symptoms of the trauma he has experienced. He needs to be welcomed and given the opportunity to heal and instead he is in the defense again. It's so sad because his situation right now is perilous. He wants to belong somewhere and safely be himself - to reject him and punish him for his background will only push him further and further from where you want him to be. This is how people become terrorists.
That's not data, it's a headline. In fact it was less than a million in 2015....
Very well said,, after all Islam is a cancer for mankind
And yet they still go there in droves.
I lived in France in the 1980's when Tunisian migrants were allowed in but the reality is that they weren't welcomed and to this day the are treated as lower class and even those born in France.
It's easy to solve. Go back to your country.
Not only Islam BUT ALL abrahamic religions are cancer to mankind

What if the refugees do not want to assimilate, as Europe is currently experiencing?  What is your answer?
Germany is not bad. Germans are not bad. Racism is negligable in Germany. It's the guilt trip that benefits the so called refugees .
Sara Rickenbacher Actually there are large rural areas in Germany with small villages and towns so they have been helpless against a few hundred men showing up. And migrant families have shown to be hostile towards Jews and homosexuals. They don't want them teaching their kids. And no what you're saying wouldn't be allowed before the mass migration. Jews and homosexuals were not attacked and feared for their lives before the mass migration of men.
Kristen Tucker haha exactly.  I spent some of the best years of my life in Dresden, doesn't erase the fact that they have a serious problem with racism over there.
Thanks for tagging this!
Thank you for the correction! I was actually trying to find the exact metrics - where is the The New York Times receiving its "data" from .. ?
Wow.  You people are unbelievable.  Until a Syrian or Libyan can shed their skin and truly become European, they will continue to face hatred and discrimination for simply "being."
The Arab countries are already islamic.
Flows of Refugees is a result from West Countries' aggresive foreign policy. Attacking the dictator regimes who wont to be a slaves, and having a tea with the cute slaves dictators. Dont blame they the refugees, point your govt instead

Puuh. Why would I read about that when I live in the country. Never said that there won't be downsides and risks. Just said, we will deal with it and it will not weaken us. And my Jewish and gay friends at least think the same way.
Thank you New York Times
I wonder what your intentions are to broadcast this one day before general elections in Germany. Feels like meddling. Perhaps well-meaning, but still meddling.
Overwhelming and heartbreaking
Y'all are really hostile and evil. Just making a point that there are good things happening here and y'all are just mean. We are currently trying to help many people from all over the world and the only thing you claim is that Germany is so full of racists. Very poor and weak attitude. But your call.
People act out when they feel they're not being heard.
Gary Tolin is the problem that they don't want to assimilate, or that the average guy on the street in some places will never accept a refugee as an equal member of society?
There is no excuse for this racist behavior but the people are here and we need to live together and we can't deine the problems but need to move on , find ways .Saxony and the East German states developed the nazi culture out of so many reasons, some lie in the communist past and also high numbers of unemployment , poverty and isolation etc and in other parts like hamburg , a very rich and open port town,people coexist very well with each other for centuries. Nothing is as simple as it seems ! Read and inform yourself more before judging or better help or set an example yourself ! It's easy to talk . Act
It is a shame that we too have white supremacists in Germany again. It is our duty to stand against those simple minded, but it would be helpful if the rest of the world showed some responsibility and also took some refugees into their countries.
Kevin Motley when all you have is devastation and death around you, where would you go? Just stay and die? Europeans and Americans have fueled conflicts in the Middle East for their own political and economic gains, they've destabilized the regions in the name of progress and democracy, with neither in sight. when it comes to dealing with its consequences, like the refugees, no one wants to clean up the mess they created.
Oh good, a lecture by an "Italian" living in Texas. So in touch with European issues! I would say "vai a quel paese" but fortunately you already have.
Jochen Breunig Well just because you live in the country doesn't mean you know what's going on. Germany doesn't have a free press nor free speech so what you perhaps read in your country is filtered.
Like how Europeans invaded every country and forced their religions and laws on people? These people are fleeing for their lives. They are bringing the only parts of home they know, the only things that make them who they are. Maybe help them assimilate, be understanding and realize it's their children who will be the Europeans, not them. Islam is not a terrible religion any more than any other religion. Women are treated like scum in the Bible, too its just covered up or ignored. These people are terrified. Have some compassion.
Mitch Apodaca
The opinion pieces by the New York Times have become increasingly slanted to the left over the years. You have to take them with a grain of salt as we say. Germany is to be applauded for the effort it's made in alleviating the world refugee crisis.
Jochen Breunig hostile and evil for telling the truth? I think not.
Europeans should be used to it since them and Arabs have been doing exactly what you pointed out for thousands of years.
Only idiots will vote Merkel after what she has done.
Wonder what the population of the Fatherland is, in the first place, and then, how many of the 2 million stayed.
@Marie I agree, I have a biracial friend born in Sweden and she tells me the Muslims especially  North african men commit lots of crimes and add to the already high rape rate in Sweden and she's afraid to walk alone at night.i don't hate Muslims but it's hard for them to integrate and that causes friction between Muslim and non Muslim communities.
Like the white supremacists are the ones who ruined Germany and the rest of Europe. Lol
I fully agree with you! For this bad situation we must thanks our brainless democratic government & leftists italian obamiots!!
What is being done to help these people? If everyone is just saying these people must act, look, and sound exactly like us from the moment they set foot in our country then it'll never happen. These people come with nothing but their language, their religion, and sometimes that is all and you expect them to immediately shed all of it and become what you've known and had all your life. If you had lost everything, including those you loved, would you not hold onto the only remnant you had to remember them while trying to move forward with your life? Also, religion while being corrupt is deeply ingrained. I invite you to just give up your beliefs.
The sun will shine again abode .
dear is assalamualiqum good night from Bangladesh thanks bulbul
Tracy Smith-Pea the same hatred they show to their own minority groups, you should see how Arab Libyans tried to purge Libya of its black population after the fall of gaddafi,now they sell black slaves, they ain't no saints.
This 2 million are nothing but a  parasites population bomb
This report is extremely one-sided and doesn‘t reflect reality. One simply cannot generalize from a small city like Bautzen to Germany as a whole. Also the refugees in Bautzen weren‘t angels.
Isn't it the Italian weekend?
Fascinating, Giulio Gaia. I invite you to give up your beliefs and everything that is meaningful in your life and just be something different. Please, tell me how easy it is because everything you are is wrong no matter how much you've lost and the only way I'll accept you is if you become exactly like me.
Hate seems to be taking over this world. I hope we can defeat it.
Stop telling lies about Germany. The picture you paint with this Video is just not true. For everyone who really wants to see how things go, please come and visit germany. Its a great country with great people and a lot to see. Dont believe everything shown in newspapers, they often show things Black and white without drawing the whole picture.
Germany will succeed, and has shown a great deal of leadership in alleviating the world refugee crisis.
Ahmed Cirro
I live Germany. I have good friends with refugee/immigrant background. Unfortunately, I have to relate what you said on # 2, due what happened recently. I have been harassed verbally by an immigrant who stopped after I threatened him by going to the police; however, I reported the incident to the group where we practice the German language.
Troll. There is no such thing as "pure" when it comes to humanity
And his peers who make bombs which blow the arms off 12 year old girls - sooo, no, the NYT VIOLIN SECTION sounds like cats . . .
The AfD will not win the election. It will either be another grand coalition or a Jamaica coalition of CDU/CSU, FDP and the Greens. I have no doubt, however, that the AfD will be represented in parliament.
Leila, where do you take your "knowledge" about Germany's press from??? You must be kidding!

Homosexuals have been attacked before, there had been hatred around before 2015. It is not only Muslim immigrants attacking homosexuals. And not every Muslim immigrant attacks homosexuals. In general homosexuals can now live their daily lives in Germany just like everyone else. That is the result of a long fight for equal rights. Just like in about every other western country, including the US!

It would be wise to refrain from making generalisations!
We have spent billions on  refugees. Most of them do not even have a legal claim to asylum. There have been hundreds of incidents of molestation by refugees from Africa  (Google cologne new years Eve 2015.) Several rapes and at least four or five murders. We will be paying billions for decades to come as those ppl dont not have an education or are not willing to learn German
Sweden altered and broadened the legal definition of rape and sexual assault so that it could be quantified and more accurately assessed and help could be more readily available as well as educational resources.

Approx 65% of sexual assault cases go completely unreported in the USA. You would probably never leave your house again if you had the true stats.

Rape hasn't increased in Sweden disproportionately due to refugees, that has been completely debunked. Please stop using that example as fact.
All Germans I know are fine with the refugees although we took in a lot. But of course there are those who are scared and have problems with a globalised world, they will vote for AfD and support alt right movements. Those criminals who attack refugees do not represent Germany and should be punished for their crimes.
Julia Jk

Omg as if it's only one sided hatred and ignorance! Why can't NYT even try to paint an unbiased picture! Why not mention how too often the refugees crimes are under reported?!? That's not important enough I get it!!
For openers if you pass through multiple safe countries and thousands of miles?You are
not a refugee.You are looking for a lifetime
of freebies.This guy could have taken a boat
like 25 miles to Tunisia.
That's the thing with xenophobia if the xenophobic person had no object to ptoject their hate and anger onto, they would be forced to confront their own internal turmoil and sickness.
Bautzen is a difficult place to be at as a refugee ... but it would be difficult for me to be there too  ... and I am a 60+ year old woman. People there  often feel cheated and are being distrustful. Having people of different origin or colour around is something they have not been used too in the former East Germany. Some of the refugees are equally distrustful, many of whom are also traumatized from the experiences in their country of origin as well as from their flight, fleeing from the horrors of war, death and hunger, the endless bombings and battles, the brutality of police and soldiers, famine, extermination, violence, torture, rape, while seeking freedom and peace. In western Germany there has been a constant influx of people from other countries, starting after WWII ... from the east, then from Italy, Spain, Greece and Turkey, later on from Russia ... In most western communities, the refugees and asylum seekers don't really pose such a significant problem and many things are being done to help with their immigration.
...but never the result of aggressive Muslim countries' domestic and foreign policies, right? Not to mention the fanatical grassroots organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood.
This desperation breeds hate. 
Hate breeds drastic measures 
Like terrorism. 
People who hate other people 
Create terrorists
Drew Riddle Not that we need more stuff to use in class.
that's true.  probably if the tables were turned, if your country were wartorn and you had to emigrate to libya, you would have been an angel.  i'm not so sure about myself...
I live in Germany, but even then can not say how Germany is in respect to the so called refugee crisis. 
I can say it's complicated. 
What you see in the video of course happend and it happens more often everybody wants. Of course we have a racism problem, but nobody can tell for shure how big this problem is. 
Tomorrow we have gerneral elctions and everybody can see how big the problem is, after the election. We have a new political party, the AfD (Alternative for Germany). Don't ask me if they are Nazis. If you call them Nazis they would say "What? You call us Nazis? You bring shame on the victems of the real Nazis." No, they dont's call themselves Nazis, of course not. But all lefties call them Nazis. But they (the right ones) call the lefties Nazis. I told you that it's complicate. 
It was today when I read an article about "Who are the AfD-Followers, are they really poor people?" And the article say "no", they are normal people, not especially poor, not "the forgotten ones". These people want more Nationalism, they want more of the proud feeling to belong to a proud Nation. 
The core of the problem is: how proud you can be without becoming a Nazi? And, more important: "Who do you mean when you talk about the German Volk (people)." 
To say "I'm proud to be German and the Germans are all poeple (including 
immigrants) seems to be ok."
To say "I'm proud of the german culture and this culture does not include foreigners" this is where Nationalism mixes with racism and can become Naziism. That's my point of view. Other people have other points of view.

Ok, how is Germany now? I would assume 80% of the Germany are fully nor-racist, and also somehow even not Nationalist. Most of the Germany think Nationalism in every kind is dangerous. We dont like this "Our Nation first"-thinking. But maybe 20% of the Germans want more Nationalism. I guess within these group you also find real Nazis.
Did you try to detox your body through your feet before spewing such nonsence?
um, i would never trade places with this guy.  i don't think he's there to get freebies...
Muslim brotherhood never attacked any western countries. But the Wahabi sect of Saudi Arabia indeed spread their terrorist ideology, resulted ISIS, Al Qaeda and all Islamist terrorist group, all of them are wahabi originated from Saudi. Your govt love to dance with them, the Saudis, and use wahabi terrorist to overthrow secular Assad of Syria, just like what ur govt did during Soviet Invasion in Afganistan, labelled Osama as Hero.
You must watch youe idiot president dance with Saudi dictator. Remind me 14 suspect of 9/11
can you tell me which article you're talking about, francis?
Argh. Former East Germany...... didn't they learn anything? Don't believe a small group and video.
I'm just talking about this bit of information: "Almost 2 million refugees came to Germany in 2015." 

 .. It is part of the text presented with this post.
Yep...
yeah, that's way high - I thought the net influx in 2015 was 800 000, and in 2016 on the order of 200 000, and this year on the order of 20 000 so far
You claim to know the truth and universally judge on things you did not even personally encounter. Your self-confidence is impressive. No one ever said everything is easy and good. No country whatsoever is without racism. Don't need to tell you about Britain first, right? So what's your point at all? We are giving our best in our communities. Only thing you do is taking away motivation and courage to make things better. If this is what you want, I sincerely congratulate you. If it's not (which I strongly hope and in fact believe), please reconsider your binary approach and don't focus on fingerpointing only. The latter is what makes it hard to believe in the good of humanity
Gary Tolin Well, this guy is saying he does. So in cases like this guy who "just want to work and help my family" education is the answer. Even people who "don't want to assimilate" will when engaged and made part of a community. Make a person feel valued does wonders for their attitude. Treating people like unwanted garbage equally does.
Natasha Singh Martin Rauber
Oh well the price we pay for oil and minerals
Lol right? I covered the trek from Syria to Munich before the 4.1 mile film yesterday, so this might be a good thing to show afterward.
Rahul Bhardwaj what a bunch of racist, xenophobic, insensitive remarks. You are much more indicative of the problem than the majority of people seeking refuge!
yeah right i know
Louise Desautels  same
Megan Clymer-Mickey Those who most often cite the "increase in rapes" in Sweden, Germany or where ever  (which actually never happend) ... are often people, who themselves view women as objects and by using these fake statistics they themselves thereby use and abuse women for their own purpose ...
Nice try motley, but no cigar - that's not why they're not welcome there. It's because all that unlabored, practically free wealth that's gushing from below the feet of the camel herding bedouin upstarts has gone to their heads. They don't give a r@ts @ss about islam nor are they concerned about their obligation to their fellow moslems, however, they're the darlings of Washington & London.
If anything, most Germans tend to overcompensate for the Nazi history, which is why Angela Merkel's decision to allow the refugees to enter in 2015 was hugely popular in Germany. The percentage of people with anti-immigrant/refugee views is still small. It looks like the AfD may get 12-15% of the vote tomorrow, so they most definitely don't speak for the vast majority of Germans. But in some areas of the former GDR, the percentage of xenophobes is much higher.
AnnA Makana ein trauriger Film, aber ein tolles Theaterprojekt in Bautzen.
Your first sentence is wrong. "Some" Europeans are tired of Refugees. Most Europeans still welcome them and will welcome them in the future. There are a lot of resources, we will take them from the rich, they have more than enough.
Instead of showing this video, media should also know what refugees did to local people, although not all the refugees are bad people still some of them pose a great threat to local people's security and culture.
Yea! Way "the" go!
They are people, plain and simple. If there are criminals amongst them send them back but for the most part, they should be helped.
Jessica Lauricella Mills There are a lot of different projects to help integrate refugees in Germany besides those provided by the state (like languages and integration courses, although there are still too few of those). For a map look here:
http://www.tagesschau.de/fluechtlingsprojekte/
I don't know about Germany however Jews in France have been moving by the thousands to Israel in the last few years. Antisemitism is back in Europe, and it's back because of Islam.
Why not, those ignorant mfs certainly don’t seem to have a problem generalizing Muslims do they? Good for the goose, good for the gander.
If only things were simple. They aren't.
Yeah, every country has this problem. Racists are not just an American thing 
Jessica Lauricella Mills And an article showing both what is working and what's not: http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/integrating-refugees-in-germany-an-update-a-1147053.html
They have had millions of refugees flee across to their borders.
Marie Balaguy
your talk is racist
Oscar Jesus, There is no denying that there are problems, but this report depicts conditions in a very specific area of Germany that is quite different from the rest of Germany, when it comes to attitudes toward refugees.
Exactly. I always say “Welcome to the hate that hate made.” You can’t treat people this way and think they’ll love or respect you for it. And you’ll definitely make them hate you back.
I think even just the first few minutes up to the point where he tells what happened to him in Libya would be good. Just a thought.
James Whittle Like in Saudi arabia
Maybe you should stop trying to tell a German what life is currently like in Germany, Leila. The man ONLY has firsthand knowledge. What do YOU have??
Then Why do they Keep Electing Her?
A friend of mine is working with young refugees and she also says that education is a major key. Also, there might be a problem with this "just wanting to work and help my family" because often it is expected that these young people find work very quickly and then send money to their families. No time for improving/adding to their education and therefore they are stuck in minimal-wage jobs. 
Also, from working with people in Syria before the war, I know that very high expectations of what is possible in Germany might also add to the disappointment: they see Europe in movies and may hear about higher wages but don't realise that their education degree is not (immediately) recognised and that the living expenses are equally high. At least, those people I was working with in Syria were shocked when I told them what I pay for my 1,5 room appartement...
Why would you welcome people with no skills, are religiously intolerant, and believe in a theocracy?  Total lunacy.
...and now the protests in St. Louis and elsewhere make perfect sense...
Yes, just like Saudi Arabia. Praise be to allah, America is Satan.
he did nit die. He was murdered.
Paul Miranda
Jochen Breunig I commend Germany's efforts, but I think you're trying too hard to be a welcoming haven for those who have been cast off for various reasons from dysfunctional societies.  Helping these people in their own nations/regions would be a preferable solution for all. I fear that this humanitarian gesture will cause Germany serious problems in the future -- Merkel's approach wasn't well-considered.
Sorry young man.  You are in Germany not Libya.  Guess that means, by what ever way, you should become german.
Actually, I'm not kidding. I've never been to Germany so I can't really make a judgement. However, I can say that here in the US minorities experience life completely different than whites. It's actually shocking because ever since I've moved to Houston, TX where there are just as many minorities as whites, I haven't had one racist encounter. In Pittsburgh, PA I knew that I was black. You could feel the hate from people.  American history is still in vain and still in our everyday lives. It's there in so many ways, but I honestly don't feel like explaining anything. I'm too exhausted lol.
Wait, the west already look at women as objects. Whats the difference lol?
Germans aren’t like that ignorant woman in the video. I’ve been there. I know.
Now do the protests in STL make any sense?
They already do lol. Those countries have accepted refugees by the millions. And they still pledge to do so, without much question. These problems also occurs there and yet they understand better.
Should I list the crimes young white men commit in America yet you don’t generalize them the way you do these men? Is it because they look like you?
2-million-number way too high - numbers were revised by the interior ministry since then.
In 2015 476649 asylum seekers, in 2016 745545 registered. So a bit over 1 million in 2 years. Even if you take into account thousands of possibly unregistered, nowhere near 2 Mio.

Clarence Rogers That's right. The majority of us is being nice and supportive. Still, the bad ones, the racists  are enough to make their life miserable. It's shameful.
Mohamad Al As lie!
Have you ever been in the "Eastern part" of Germany?
Germany has free speech and free press. There is Antisemitism, yes. It was there before The Refugees come. People show it more openly since the rising of all these Nazis in some european countries.
Kevin De Castro Ferreira
The very vast majority of those you're referring to are neither white supremacists nor simple-minded. Stop generalizing.
We?
Looking for statistics? 476.649 people asked for asylum in Germany in the year 2015. Source: https://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Publikationen/Broschueren/bundesamt-in-zahlen-2015.pdf?__blob=publicationFile

745.545 in 2016. Source: https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/76095/umfrage/asylantraege-insgesamt-in-deutschland-seit-1995/

1.2 million people within TWO years. Far from the 2 million mentioned in the headline.
It is good to see this point of view, however there is most definitely another side to this story.
James Whittle You are not talking about Germany, do you know that? The rich in Germany did not get rich by working hard an sacrificing.
Wessen Arsch willst du ölen?
Things are not that simple. He was accepted into Germany. He is provided food, shelter, medical care, and he has significant legal rights. I understand the dynamics make it difficult, but he could theoretically have taken steps to stay out of trouble and improve his chances for permission to stay (for example, not hang out in the public square, and instead work intensely with his friend and anyone else he can find to learn German). There are those who do, and their outcomes are vastly better than his.  There are refugees whose single-minded pursuit as soon as they reach Germany is to learn the language. You don't have to take formal language classes for this, you can find someone, anyone, who knows German and is willing to help.
your using a computer or a cell phone so yah we
James Whittle the whole world knows that ;)
That is why we need to make an exception to the non-violence principle and encourage Antifa to punch out Nazis. There are always exceptions to ruling principles and these guys do warrant it.
Erik, well-phrased and I agree with your overall assessment and strongly support the idea of helping on site and build up wealth in these nations. We have been in similar situations before (eg balcan wars in the 90s) same fears as back then and look we are stronger than ever. Yet, we absolutely must not become a welcome Haven and strictly need to manage the process of incoming foreigners. Also, we need to consequently send back people who are either delinquents or if at their home they are safe (given that they haven't integrated thus far). So all in all I am very realistic of what our government has done. And a humanitarian act can't be that wrong. It's about how we handle it now.
Thank you for the validated data source  - much appreciated!
You don't invade an open door, the refugees comes if the doors are open, if they are juridically welcomed. 
I think the EU countries should close for entrance and concentrate about getting the best out of those already here . We can't keep absorbing the refugees or the economic emigrants.
It is sad,but that is just how it is.
I don´t understand
I disagree. We carry responsiblity for our fellow humans, and we should do what we can to help as many people in dire need as we can, even if there is a significant price. Germany is managing OK. We wouldn't be able to handle an unlimited influx, but an influx of 1% or 2% compared to the prior German population we can handle. Wir schaffen das :)
In Denmark, the impression we get from the media is that there is a lot of tension in Germany because of the challenges that came with the sudden influx of refugees. But at the same time Merkel is predicted to win the election, despite being responsible for this. Does this mean that the issues are lesser than what we're being told, or that Merkel is so strong in other areas, that it cancels the refugee issue out?
what an awful thing to say
Your comment is so stupid I can't even find words for it. You think hate and racism is inherited? Please go back to school. Or, more likely, just go to school.
Didn't thought through. That might be a single reality but it has nothing to do with the whole thing. Sorry, nonsens.
Europe, especially Germany "welcomed" refugees because they need cheap labor. They sell more than they can produce and need more people to fill the assembly lines. That's it.
easy solution - go home, Abode! You are an illegal immigrant, Germany does not need you, nor did it Invite you.
2 million came, we followed 1.  Meaningfull ?
Wish Abode could come to Canada
Remember the old axiom -- No good deed goes unpunished.
@New York Times: NYTimes, really?! Almost 2 million? That isn't even close to accurate.
Jessica Lauricella Mills just nuts what you just said.
Only one problem -- Antifa are Nazis 2.0. I'm surprised people don't all see this.
Joseph Noh I don´t think they need them for tis. I think they need them for justifying the low wages.
I do apologise for my criticism. I do admit that I've only seen Germany as a tourist, and I don't know a lot about its society.
Italy should not have to bear the brunt of it, that much is true. But the West created climate-change and endless war, so EU and USA will have to deal with the exodus from the countries they got fat on
No worries, but Germans themselves have a lot of issues with poverty that must be solved.
Really?  Germany, led by Merkel is a rightwing country? Last I noticed Germany was not causing trouble for its neighbors and was producing goods and technology used around the world.  These refugees come from miserable dysfunctional societies where people slaughter each other over nothing; they manufacture and invent nothing and they can't govern themselves.  Then the refugees go to healthy societies, demand services, cause trouble and then whine that life's not great... like it was back home! Don't tell me... let me guess -- you're from one of these dysfunctional societies?
Well that's New York Times for you
the people hate this black guy is right wing type. not left. both side can take charge of the country.
Hey NYT ,how about you make a story on Leroy Sane.His father's a muslim man from Africa , his mom from Germany and he's making a killing for Manchester City football club and will be the next big star in the national team in Germany .
Or maybe because of things like these https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10159853841425354&id=95475020353
Yolanda Povedano Duro
Markus how do you know who she is reffering to? If she is talking about white supremacists then all of the people she is reffering to are white surpremacists. Funny that you feel the need to deny that.
Some countries in the world must stop causing, supporting civil wars in some countries.. and the same countries must stop exploiting  same countries natural resources..
I was hoping and waiting for a happy ending...but there was not
Poor kid. There are people in this country who have more compassion and understanding. I hope he gets a chance to go to school and find his path in this world. Stay strong Abode!
Erik Larsen Antifa stands for anti-fascist and Nazis were fascists. It is surprising that you don't know this.
Mohamad Al As, which Gulf countries accept refugees?  Jordan, Lebanon, even Iraq and Syria accepted refugees, but not Saudi Arabia or the Emirates.
Extremely moving video. However, I live in Germany and personally know a lot of Germans that speak out against all far-right/ Nazi actions. Some of them even work double shifts at the asylums to help and care for the migrants coming in. I trust the professional Journalism of NYT and been a subscriber for already quite many years but this video shows Germany in a bad light which I completely disagree with, knowing many personal stories.
That is a sad story - someone needs to push the reset button for Abode, he needs a fresh start. What is obvious to us in this piece by looking closely at his story, unfortunately gets lost in the masses. I bet Germany is overwhelmed and does not have the resources needed to apply individual care which is clearly needed here. Kudos to the engaged director's project taking kids off the streets and allowing them to come together on stage and showcasing their artistic talents. It's saddening that nothing seems to come out of it. But, there are many stories with good endings - I would challenge the NYT to keep the journalistic balance and broaden the view.
F abode
Really great and sad story about the immigration process in Europe. The focus is on Germany but the same situation happens in other countries.  Immigration doesn’t take place in a vacuum: on both sides, you have human beings with their own history. The anti-immigrants parties deludes their voters by making the “other” accountable for their personal difficulties (unemployment, perceived failure, etc,.). The origins of their woes are much more complicated to solve than just throwing the immigrants out of their countries (while the developed nation can not keep up with their ageing population and the related issue of the baby-boomers retirement). We need to integrate them in our societies but it will not happen in a hate filled climate.
Elisa Melendey McGuire
This video is incredibly one sided. It does not reference at all the strain that such a large migration poses on Germany and other countries. I wonder where all the so 'hate' comes from in the Germans.  there is always two side to every story.

"I've never been to Germany so I can't really make a judgment." Your statement pretty much starts and ends there.
Michael DeCesare what makes you think that Germany is ruined? Is it because we have the number one passport in the world and the highest economy rating of Europe? 
Mira Tell , yes, all of this is true. Merkel will win the election even if some people shout at her being a "traitor of the german people". These people want to bring her to court (reminds me a bit what Trumpists wanted to do with Hillary). These people will vote for the AfD (Alternative for Germany). The tomorrow election will show how big the problem is.
Your number of 2million is incorrect. Not even 1million refugees came to Germany in 2015.
Alexandra Lehar you exactly make my point. What you've all just said is false. There has been repostings coming out of Germany that migrant families refuse to have their children taught by gay teachers. And of Jews and especially Jewish children being bullied and beat at schools by migrant children.
Yes it is. You must have been there. See, German beer unites the world, not hate and bad comments. 
Yes! Exactly.
Jochen Breunig but isn't it true?in many parts of Eastern Germany that is the case.there are very bad people and there are good people,in between some couldn't be bothered.Racism mustn't be encouraged in any form.fortunately,Angela Merkel is trying hard to make things better for integration and acceptance but she can't change everyone's mind.
To think of so many youths lost and alone in the world is gut wrenching. Their world got turned upside down so quickly, without a clear path back to a life where they don't feel threatened. Goes to show how disaster and despair can happen to anyone in an instant. I get that the alt right is trying to make sense of their new reality and fighting to "survive". What they don't realize is their hatred makes their environment less safe, creating greater division and inequity for everyone including themselves. Rather than being driven by distrust and prejudice to tear others down, choose compassion and hope to bring everyone up.
Ib, never claimed anything different than from what you are saying. Everything you write I confirm 100%
Alexandra Lehar Germany relies heavily on its exports to remain competitive in the EU. Cheap labor = low wages. We're talking about the same thing.
More US created Refugees. The obvious and predictable consequences of a capitalist foreign policy driven by control over resources and profits. 

Thanks American Imperialism for ruining the lives of Libyans and creating Far Right movements across the world, including here in the US.

Kristen Tucker I have also seen documentaries about the so called "German welcome culture" and about people who opened their homes to refugees. The negative headlines get more attention than the success stories, I am afraid.
Absolutely true!
Same europeans who invaded and raped africa...dumping their slum dwellers on the continent poisoning it....
Imagina o estado psicológico desse coitado. É muita pressão, e eu fico triste de ver, realmente triste pela palavra que ele escolheu pra definir a situação dele (perdido). E ele tá mesmo, perdido em mundo de ódio e ignorância. Mas não se pode descartar uma coisa, cada caso é um caso. Olha o comentário abaixo, traduz ele, o da Marie Francis. Logo abaixo, ela explica um ponto de vista que é inegável também.
Maybe it wasn’t the greatest idea to let in millions of uneducated immigrants who can’t be absorbed, will be on welfare forever, and in many cases are Muslims that hate Germany and the West.  Sounds like a perfect recipe to create discord and destroy the social fabric.
This is not correct on many levels . But one thing we seem to forget is that the migration of people will continue. This is not a German , Italian or even a European problem,  this a global problem that will just worsen with war and natural disasters. Germany just happened to be one of the only countries that did not turn their backs on the humans that were and still are in need. Of course there is so much wrong and many problems but the majority of those that come to Germany are still treated with respect.
I believe that if they could go back to their countries ( infrastructure must be built first and that will take years ) the majority would.
While I do think that good journalism should leave readers uncomfortable, some of the discomfort brings up rational questions: 1) why is NYT depicting Germany as a very much nazi country when it's not? Like everywhere nowadays, there is some discussion about immigrants but this video depicts it in a way more extreme fashion then what it is 2) how do you endorse a story like this when you have in fact no way to check said story? To me the fact that his mom told him to just jump on a boat sounds weird, as I've always heard how these illegal boats cost a lot of money often forcing families to sel all their belongings 3) why doesn't this boy speak german if he has been in a Germany for the past 2,5 years? I could go on, but the point is I'm not sure of what kind of journalism this actually was...
Eu vi... achei fera a reportagem por isso te marquei arreganho né

They have to be integrated not segregated !
Germany is not that bad, and immigration in Western Europe is not new, only basic Americans would believe Islam is new to Europe and dark skinned people are a discovery to Western Europe. Now I acknowledge there is racism like everywhere but compared to America, Western Europeans are angels. But hey we're reading The New York Times, where people who never experienced oppression, war and racism themselves are trying to teach other white yuppies the ways of the world. Germany is way more progressive and open than the US, white women in Germany don't cling on their purses when foreign looking people walk close to them, can't say the same about some places in America.
I almost hate to say it, but it's a little comforting to know my country isn't the only one suffering from a bad case of complete idiocy in select pockets. 

One day, I don't know when, we'll all realize we're all just people trying to make it. I hope I'll see it, but I don't think I will.
This video is utter B.S New York Times! Try harder next time...this is pathetic.

Leila Dowlatshahi...What are you talking...are you nuts? Of course we have free speech and a free media!Go to bed. We live here and I reassure you, it's better as you can imagine.
First of all I am surprised how badly NYT did their recherche...we take about 800.000 refugees in 2015. That makes a huge difference.
Ryan Campion we will see. Tomorrow are the elections. Yes, I think AFD will be strong ... 15%, but I'm not sure if we are loosing cause of that.  
And the example chosen in the video exist, but is a really extrem one. Germany dose not look like that. Just in small villages in the east and maybe between some mountains in Bavaria. 

Come visit us  before you judge
A realistic, insightful assessment, Marie Francis!
Please, don't list your subjective and ill-informed opinions as if they were facts
I tell you as a German, this video is true..it's from a part in Germany ( Ex DDR) were Neonazi are a problem. BUT the unbelievable fantastic side of this so called refugee crisis was and is, that millions of voluntary people are doing their best to help.
Americans have ZERO moral authority to criticize us, European citizens, for the aftermath of the debacle that THEY THEMSELVES, in their eternal pursuit of wealth and world dominance, have created. 

None of those self-serving, virtue-signaling American liberals and leftists would be happy if all of a sudden the equivalent of 2,41% of their population would enter the USA. In America, the equivalent would be a whopping 7,786,000 new residents, the vast majority of which do NOT come from war-torn Syria (only approximately 20% actually do), the vast majority of which lack the necessary academic credentials or other skills to join the economy, all of which are draining our welfare system in detriment of the citizens originally meant to give something back to us in consideration of the extremely high taxes which we pay (and which, again, no American would want to pay). Moreover, the vast majority are Muslims, whose culture is incompatible with ours (due to their ideologically justified discriminatory treatment of women and appalling treatment of atheists, homosexuals and Jews) and, to add insult to injury, not a small number amongst them are committed Islamists hell bent on pursuing their dream of a world-wide Caliphate in which Shar'ia law prevails. 

You don't have to be a Nazi to be opposed to people who have never worked a day in their lives in Germany and who have never paid into our welfare system not only benefiting from it (while those who have worked really hard see their future pensions disappear and their current ones be utterly insufficient), but on top of it, engaging in social-welfare fraud by cashing welfare to the tune of more than US$10,000 per month by using multiple fake identities (this has actually happened), and/or getting more than US$350,000 a year without having to work a single day for taking care of their four wives and dozens of children (this has actually happened, too). 

You don't have to be a Nazi to be outraged by the German legal system putting people behind bars for refusing to pay the ca. $20 mandatory monthly fee which we have to pay per household to support the TV and radio system, regardless of whether we own a TV or a radio (this has actually happened), while judges set Muslim "refugee" rapists (including of children!) free alleging that since their cultures are so radically different, they are not responsible for rape (that, too, has happened).

You don't have to be a Nazi to be outraged by the fact that there were nearly 1000 cases of sexual abuse and rape on New Year's Eve 2015 in Cologne, perpetrated in their overwhelming majority by Muslim migrants, while the official reaction was to try to set up a cover up and suggesting, like the major of Cologne did, that the best alternative to avoid rape is for women to keep an arm length's distance from would-be rapists. 

You don't have to be a Nazi to be outraged by the German government claiming that there are no funds available to help victims of natural catastrophes (for example, massive floods during the summer) while concomitantly setting aside €20 BILLION (!) per YEAR to help the "refugees." 

I could go on and on, but it is pointless to try to convince liberals and leftists, particularly of the typically ignorant, solipsistic and exceptionalist American kind, that they are completely unaware of the reality on the ground and that they are, in fact, hypocrites.
Bautzen is notorious in Germany. I would not live there. And please notice how many people attented the show even there.
Do we live in the same country?  there ARE hate crimes against refugees. It is a fact. Refugees homes being set on fire, spray painted, demonstrations saying they should all leave. The fact that the AFD has so many supporters is proof alone that something is seriously wrong with the people in this country. Of course there are also good people who reflect and do not condemn people for where they come from. But you should be able to acknowledge the fact that Germany is far from perfect in this respect and that this video is clearly not a lie.
New York Times.are you Kidding? This is king Abode. He has 24 crime Investigation running and is a Well known Trouble maker.he is Showing Off with an ak47 in His Facebook Profile.

Aga Depta yes with these words i think we might really live in different countries.
Currently, more than 3 million Syrian immigrants in Turkey benefit from the highest levels of accommodation, education, health and humanitarian aid. Spent so far is over 9 billion dollars. Yours sincerely

It's not like your Police would tell us about any sexual assaults that happen.
And perhaps, *just perhaps*, we, European citizens, don't want to see DREADFUL and OBSCENE ATROCITIES committed by zealous Muslims, like the ones that The New York Times itself reported about, happening on European soil:

First off you sound as bad as trump , secondly rape and violence was there before refugees came to Italy,trying to separate yourself from other countries isn't going to help Italy, you had a government that mismanaged funds, you have a housing crisis, you haven't done enough for the elderly in that country.  And yes I can speak to this as I was born there and have seen the changes

His experiences might be about the same in Denmark as in Germany. It is a common misconception that victims are automatically nice people. It is always stressful to move country, but in Ireland and America, I found people to be friendly and very patient with my transition issues. I can only imagine the stress of moving in a state of conflict, and how much more that would make me an inconvenient newcomer. Extreme patience required.
We are all Human, no matter which country we were born in. We must all learn to live with each other in peace.

Mary Garvie ... that's a false equivalence and a generic narrative. If you really want to be critical of my comment it'll help you to have some context. Rather than prejudice me for saying they brought in to many. 

They brought in to many because already there is a huge problem in Western Europe with Muslim immigrants that have no desire to assimilate and congregate into likeminded communities and in some cases they radicalize and project their provincial prejudices on their host communities. Partly due to local prejudices reinforcing their isolation and partly due to religious views on woman. 

Most of these war refugees will end up living in these communities which will create a greater risk for both terrorism and economic isolation.

With that said I fully support bringing in thousands of Syrian refugees to the USA with the hope that if they choose to stay they will want to assimilate and attend school and send their children to college... but not 1 million of them like they did in Europe. That's going to be problem.
Saudi Arabia is a horrible monarchy abusing human rights; the U.S. and countries like Germany need to be the example in humanely and generously managing human migration. We're a globalized world. We cannot wait for the the worst places to be better before we work on our own good/mediocre/bad policies for dealing with humanitarian crises.

She would have you think that even though I am a German citizen (with dual Mexican citizenship) I am not a German because "I don't look the part." Remember this exchange when people like her use it to claim being victims of "racism" and say things such as "what does an American look like anyway?" Thanks for your ammunition!

It's not just the leaders who have learned a lot from the Nazi history. There is strong culture of remembrance. Every time you turn on the TV you see films, programs, documentaries etc. critical of the Nazis.  Check out some opinion polls, the majority are pro-refugees. Also look at the vast numbers of volunteers.  My sister has tutored refugee children and given them piano lessons. An aunt teaches german classes to refugees. My parents donated several bicycles. A cousin and his wife have built friendships with Syrian refugees, invited them into their home, cooked meals with them, etc.  There is definitely a small vocal minority who are xenophobic and racist, and in some areas of the former  (like where this report was filmed) there are larger numbers. But ot
Not just even to refugees, but they, Germans, treated even the foreigners or international students as a second-class citizen. With my experience in Aachen, such a nightmare. A sugar-coated hell!
... oops... but it's a minority.
Efrain Cordero
Sad story, and unfortunate situation for this young men. The man is brave and shows he is trying to adapt himself to The German society, needs help. I’m sure not all Germans act like in this documentary and not all refugees are criminals.
Aga Depta Exactly, and not only against refugees but foreigners in general. I have friends studying in cologne for example that couldnt leave the house for a day because there were "demonstrations" from AFD and extreme right so it wasnt safe. It is true that there are also germans who support the refugees, but to be honest this is the first time Ive seen a video showing the opposite side and from the eyes of a refugee.
The thing is they have to show everything, I've seen many videos showing Angela Merkel and different politicians or even civilians welcoming the refugees, but it's the first time I've seen this type of videos and it's important to create awarness because some people have no idea this is also happening.
Hi Romina, I do see and agree with your point. My only concern was that this is an isolated event that happened in one part of the country and I was afraid it will overshadow the good that is being done in other major parts, which is what I wanted to point out. The reporting and the video are as accurate as they can get. The timing is also particularly sensitive because Germany is heading into elections tomorrow.
It would have been more responsible to set a lower cap to refugees, they need help but resources are limited. Now there are more refugees than the country can culturally assimilate.

Because they are telling the story of a refugee. So of course it's one sided. That was their aim. That also doesn't make it a problem. They are telling his story.
Shehan Goonesekera
There's more sides to the story but the New York Times refuses to print out anything else
I work with refugees here in the US and there are many of us working to warmly welcome and resettle new immigrants. I volunteered almost full time these past two years until the refugee numbers slowed to a drip due to Trump's anti-refugee ban. We are desolate. But here in America we also have Nazis. Charlottesville was a dreadful event that showcased the horrible actions of some Americans who are support Trump's animosity and are pushing to revoke all privileges except those of the alt-right. So, we too have these stories happening. Not in my circle, but in my country. We just have to keep trying to do what's right in the face of bigotry, anti-other-religions and racism.
What started as millions of people fleeing a war zone, became immigration into (only) rich countries.
Hello, of course your country will change as any other country welcoming lots of people with a totally different background and suffering from trauma. And that s why people share different opinions about the crisis in the first place,  but for me it s very simple u either see all people as equals or you don't, u either believe humans should help each other or you don't. u say a lot of them are criminals and rapists well those should be put in jail or sent back. The rest are charming people trying to heal and adapt themselves to their new environment i truly believe.
Similar to the U S
What an insane world we live in when we talk about issues like this. These "refugees" are overwhelmingly economic migrants who will NEVER integrate. Germany already has a huge group of Turks that have been there for a very long time who refuse to integrate and show far more loyalty to Turkey and Islam then they do to Germany.

https://www.merkur.de/politik/vergewaltigungen-durch-zuwanderer-sagt-kanzlerin-merkel-zr-8686095.html

The crime they bring is absolutely undeniable. This is of course besides the massive economic cost that is being pushed on the German people in support of a group to uneducated and lazy to ever really contribute regardless.

This is of course besides the ever increasing state security issues that come with taking in this many third world economic migrants. The formation of ghetto's and no go zones is a forgone conclusion. 

Angela Merkal and the idiots that support her have destroyed Germany. Many of you are to stupid to see it yet, but you will.

Once again its stunning to me that all that the far right had to do was give the left enough rope to hang themselves and they practically jumped in the noose.
Lol. Guy Daoust you have no idea. Antifa use fascist tactics if you cant see that then you are lost.

Kristen Tucker, I'm afraid you are trying to identify a very American form of near-institutionalised racism in a German nation that does not segregate the way the US does. 
Bautzen is a small town located in the extreme east, near the Czech and Polish borders, in a region that is still struggling to adapt to a country it has reintegrated after having known the Third Reich and the Soviet-oriented GDR regime in succession. Against such a series of drastic changes in political and cultural settings, a quarter of a century is a very short period. And nevertheless, this forlorn town of Bautzen displays, even in this documentary, a level of solidarity and support toward immigrants that I would be hard put to identify anywhere in the US toward any minority, even of US citizens.
In Germany, by and large, this solidarity is real, it is heartfelt, and it works. 
The Germans' efforts towards immigrant integration (not Mrs. Merkel's decisions, mind you, but the day-to-day efforts and sacrifices of the German people) should put most other Western nations to shame. Two years after 2 million refugees were let in, the country has neither dissolved in civil war nor enabled a return of fascism to power. So far it hasn't even unseated its chancellor.
For all these reasons, the least the Germans deserve is a bit of recognition and support - not baseless accusations rooted in ignorance and prejudice.
Return in your country if you don't like Germany. Is it better the Africa? A place without human rights?

Abode came from what it seems a precarious personal situation, war made it worse and becoming a refugee without prospects was the last draw. It is increasing obvious -regardless of what progressive minds want to emphasize- that European politicians unleashed a Pandora's box when they opened the floodgates to people from all over, a great deal of them not bonafide refugees. Europe wasn't ready or didn't ready itself at a minimum to handle things differently. Here is one single story of the results!
Tami Maximiliane
I was in Italy just before the first waves of migrants started...frankly, I do not know how Italy, with its own, long list of social and economic issues has been able to cope. Eurocrats have, for the most part left Italy to deal with this onslaught on her own. It is beyond immoral to expect Italians to shown boundless tolerance for a mess imposed on them, period.
How about we focus on the thousands of towns that overcame their fear, countless happy stories & moments equally shared by refugees & Germans instead of taking examples and making it look like the end of the world in Germany. Of course there are problems and new challenges but they can't be fixed in such a short time. Focus on the message that we're sending which is humanity first and love & peace in the world. This report is not showing both sides and hence is only contributing to fear and hatred.
Also, how about we wait for the election results before stating that the far right movement is about to rise .
They wouldn't want those hordes in their homelands and are delighted to see Europe forcibly absorb them, for a variety of reasons and later purposes. So much for Arab Muslim brotherhood and compassion. I hate to admit that Russia's hardline approach to illegal immigration and flow of self-labeled refugees has been more realistic.
Luca Lenbacher
The issue is simple: Many ordinary German and European ctizens with no extremist leanings are rightfully reasoning that the refugee flow has not been managed properly from the onset, and are voicing their concerns and channeling their political say-so. Those in the margins of the left will quickly label and misrepresent them as right-wingers. The extreme right will, of course, profit as much as it can. Traditional political parties will also discredit movements like AfD for their own benefit.

Every time I go back to Sweden (where I grew up) I see the changes.

I'm an American living in a small town in Bavaria. I have Syrian refugees living in the apartment below mine. The local German community has rallied around these two men and two boys to get them furniture and appliances, to drive the boys to soccer practice, to help them with groceries, and just to visit and spend time with them. I felt the need to offer this as evidence that it's not like this everywhere and not all Germans share the same perspective.
I'm sorry, but this is Germany. The fact that so many people would prefer to pretend that these issues are restricted to the east is part of this reason why these problems are not addressed.
Nick Lanolin Underwood
Quite frankly white supremacist, racism is inevitable when a country slowly turns towards a multicultural policy. This is compounded when there is indifference, inability to assimilate and demands made without earning respect for its culture. 
When its local cultures are seen to be eroding , it is where the nationalist and the supremacist will react at the expense of minorities. 
I see this as an inevitable fact Germany will face soon.

The far-right movement is a great problem in some eastern parts of Germany. Lets hope, todays election comes out less far-right than the forecasts say. But I think, the majority of Germany is NOT as in the film (did not watch it till the end). Many of us (Europeans) are still welcoming refugees - sadly the "against" are screaming louder.

Nico Ro mi sa che conosce più l'Italia Marie, che vive in Texas e no te che vivi in Italia....
Megan Clymer-Mickey that is absolutely not true. Rape crisis in Sweden has not been debunked. On the contrary, it has been largely covered up. There was a huge scandal with over a thousand rape cases being covered up by the police for the fear of being accused of racism. Sexual assault has increased exponentially with the influx of refugees. This is the unfortunate fact, and you can be as liberal as the next guy, but denying it doesn't help your cause one bit.
There arw hate crimes in Germany obviously. But highlighting the single cases of violence undermines all of the cases where integration works and happened! So please consider this for the full picture. I come from a small town where integration of Syrians and Afghans etc. worked out pretty well. One of my best friends is Afghan. Consider that those cases highlighted in the media are single cases in single towns (just as in the video. Bautzen is nor the whole of Germany!), and seldomly the cases where things worked out.
Isabella Conomos
Livier Storms, lee los comentarios todos muy fuertes.
Those hateful Germans.  Always hate in their hearts.
It's so sad that this is only the bad sides the media is showing. Here in Germany there were lots of great happenings as well - people greeting the refugees. Also so many social workers and helping hands made it possible for the people in need to feel a little more welcome. Schooling and integration programs were starting! It's so so sad hat media makes it seem it was a big mess! Yes, lots of things haven't been going well but hey - there's so many different cultures clashing - Religions and ways of living! Of course that's not easy! But should we send them all back to the war zones and horrible conditions they came from! We are all humans and we need to help each other! It's actually a big shame that so many countries in the EU had not been taking in any refugees - or just so little. They've been running away from their duty and integrity of a string western country?!
Times, I'm disappointed seeing such one-sided journalism!
The DACA issue with the dreamers, well technically they are still protected for another 5 months or so but going back and forth on that and not knowing for sureity what will happen after, is very tough for them I can imagine.

I personally am a doctor and very curious about the health care overhaul. The repeal and replace on Ocare! I mean is it really that bad to pay a little more for programmes like Medocaid and Medicare so that some of the less fortunate can be taken care of? Giving autonomy to individual states and their governors to decide on caps for people with pre-exisiting conditions, while it sounds good, without an overlying clearly defined federal outline, things CAN go really south quite fast. Not all but many people might be left out of the system.

The violence on the streets and the general racism, esp the incident in Charlottesville where this woman was killed was also quite terrible, don't you think?
Is it really a problem that a good portion of Germans do not want their country to be flooded by immigrants? It's not only Germany btw, it's the sentiment in most european countries but also in North America, Australia, Japan, China, South Korea and in most third world countries, etc. It's completely normal and natural. And It's not because of racism (even though there's some of it). It's more a reflex of self-preservation. Recently, Germany has done more than its share for the refugees. We should stop criticizing.
I am shocked about what I read here.

Seeing most of the comments here... I am not hoping  for a happy ending anymore. :(
Get your numbers straight, NYT. In 2015 there were 890.000 refugees coming to Germany. Who says everything higher than this is a rightwing populist trying to manipulate the people. And I‘m saying this as a German.
Michelle Bray it is not true in the sense that it presents an exception as the general rule and present individual negative reactions toward immigrants as institutionalized discrimination. That is simply not the case. I find that media in general would be well advised to think twice before spewing their utterly biased views so as not to inflame difficult situations and spread endless conflicts and resentment.

But seriously they're the only ones trying and I get really upset at the world expecting Germany to be perfect dealing with a difficult and challenging situation . Like come on. Of course there are a few unhappy but there are much more who are simply lovely about it.
Zachary Dalisky, the existence of a fringe neonazi minority in the eastern hinterland is neither an indicator of structural racism nor proof of a segregationist mentality pervading the overall population.
Conversely, I am curious as to what your "this is Germany" postulate aims to  refer to: possibly the fact that about 12% of persons residing in the country were born outside its borders?
Long story short, if, as you state, these issues were not being addressed, Germany today would be a social, ethnic and religious battlefield. 
It isn't.
Verde güey, la gente está bien loca
why doesn't he speak fluent German? Absurd.
Erika Czerniejewski Radical Islam has bleeding knees praying that their moderate muslims will mature in their faith and become radicalized. These people are flooding your borders with one purpose and that purpose is to remove you and everything else that they do not like or will not convert to Islam from this planet.
Yeah, because the US colonized 3/4 of te world... right?
Christian Salazar Islam is the breeding ground for terrorism that is all Islam does. Islam is not a religion or race It is a Murderous government. A Hostile government of Intimidation, Placing people in Bondage, Raping, Polygamists, Inbreeding, Suicidal, Sheep screwing, Child abusing, Pedophiles.
  refugee     
I'm really so sorry to watch this video, it makes me cry!! First of all,in this world we are all human being and as you want a safety lifestyle like job, home etc. they want just a safety 'head' let's say. Just to be alive and to breathe, is the only hope they have. Of course the criminality is part of this global world but it doesn't mean that the european people are the clearest one and the refugees are they, that bring just criminality in Europe. Secondly you cannot say the islams are the baddest one and you as an italian, catholic not! 
they have right to bring their culture because it's part of their personality. It's like saying now, why do you cook pasta, or why mostly of italians in germany have opened italian restaurants. That means they have bring also their culture here so..!!!!
The european have to learn to give respect in order to take it!
We have to be more open-minded to live with different nationalities. We can never judge other lives and the personality of a person just because he comes from arabia or whatever! For ex. If you don't like my profile picture just don't like it and go away, it's the same with people, if you don't like someone just go away. 
It's so simple. We don't have to react like this!
Blah men objectify women around the world as a  norm. Get a grip
Jessica Lauricella Mills all the self serving, virtue signaling Americans like you would be singing to another tune if the Atlantic Ocean wasn't protecting you from an Islamic invasion from Africa and the Middle East. Incidentally: all that turmoil that you attribute to the "West" would be more accurately attributed to the USA, and its perennial imperialistic obsession. If NATO hadn't forced its European members to defend the USA after 9/11, Islamists would have no "excuse" to attack us. So: shut up! BTW: there are refugees in your country, too. They are called MEXICANS and they are fleeing violence, American imperialism and poverty, too, and I don't see any Americans embracing them and opening their HOMES AND BANK ACCOUNTS to them. You people are hypocrites!
Tassia Aimée Haase
Kristen Tucker where are you now that Jean pointed out the flaws in your argument?
Anne Draper yes, it matters. If you would like to have them in your own backyard or, better yet, your home, put your money where your mouth is and sponsor an African or Middle Eastern man, or two, and bring them to the USA. Hypocrite!
And the success stories? The hundreds of thousands of people whom, despite having to face great hardship, ultimately have the opportunity to make a better life for themselves? Germany has done a great thing.
Absolute crap.

Really? We took in approximately two million people. Which equates to more then two percentage of the population of the Federal Republic of Germany. What would you expect would happen in the US if you took in about 6.5 million refugees. Please think about it for a moment. Would you expect such a measure is capable of increasing peace and quiet in the society?
I hope you guys are right and the AfD will not become a second NSDAP. In my opinion they are definitely a far right party, so not electable for me.
Right.
Karim Justice
If you don't want refugees swarming your countries, instead of simply complaining about the problem, reacting to the situation and scurrying to implement adhoc measures when it happens, why don't you push your governments to adopt a more proactive effective long term approach towards promoting peace & stability in the developing world and prevent the conditions that give rise to refugees and asylum seekers in the first place. No one becomes a refugee just for $hits & giggles - most people become refugees due to dire circumstances when it becomes difficult to survive in their own countries.
This story is the exception. 2 million people and you choose to focus on the exception

Not all of us American women act like that. Europe is going through a huge crisis. It's time to admit it.

Zachary Dalisky Wow big words and you obviously got no clue what's going on here on a day-to-day basis. The statement "[...]these problems are not addressed" is so off. If there's one thing which is permanently addressed in German politics (by statements, policies and programmes), media, education and civil engagement then it is the fight against far right-wing attitudes including racism. And the reason for that is of course our history and our responsibility to stand up against such movements and to prevent the rise of similar attitudes again which turned Europe into a slaughterhouse. 
I'm not stating there is no racism but to claim that this is not being addressed is ridiculous and insulting.

This is exactly why education needs to be accessible. This young man is in the prime of his life and yet has no future, no direction, nothing to give him hope. He was engaged with the theater troupe, but what else? what else can he do in his day to day? As a teen were i to live at a refugee shelter with no hope or way out I'd be frustrated, angry and depressed. 

The question of refugees is how to we help integrate them and help them develop skills to become productive members of society?
These are economic migrants, do not bring value, scourge of living in Islamic mindset, don't want to change their ways,assimilate, sorry, let's put a mosque in front of NY times office, and see how it works.
Selma Khalil
From a culture that stole it's staple food: pasta. Europe is getting the legacy of its imposed supremacy. The reason why it's not going well, it's because Europeans are afraid of evolution. You're 10 years behind on the rest of the world, but this world is evolving.  I remember going to Cameroon on vacation, and there were 3 Italian men on the plane. One of them had obviously been dragged into going to Cameroon  by one of his friends, he said: ma che cosa voi a fare? His friend responded by saying: hai tutto a fare. If you're smart you'll get my point. Europe is poor and used up, still it appeals to some. Everybody has an Eldorado.  For you it's Texas. Be mindful of what's going on, and come out of your small world. Ciao ragazza.

if u cant think, just blame the US
Marie McSwarry The Munich police (polizei München) post daily reports on their Facebook page on various incidents at Oktoberfest (Wiesn.)

Just because the truth doesn't fit your narrative, please don't besmirch the police who do a fantastic job year round.

Yelena Krasin Salazar oh dear Yelena, youve been brainwashed :)

Jessica Lauricella Mills then dont vote for presidents who start wars only to get another term. Now the US is trying to "bring democracy" to N Korea, as it did to all those Middle Eastern countries and then let the others take care of it. 

China would probably have to clean and deal woth future korean refugees. So please..

I just so love when Americans are telling how someone should integrate into European society, when you ban them to even travel. Plus if some parts of other races are not feeling the same as majority, dont tell about Europe where everything was going great until recently
Very bad timing right before the German election  we can watch those documentaries on public tv almost every day, but they also show successful stories, which I can say for Abode, is impossible since he states himself that he cannot be helped in the end of the movie. It takes your free will and some courage to attend language classes, to meet local people and to educate yourself. Not many companies are going to take you as an intern if you only speak Arabic and have the qualities of a primary school student. I'm more concerned that Abode is getting involved with too many far-left people who see refugees as an object to fight their opponents (right wing opinions and the authorities e.g. the police) with. Still I'm happy to see that Germany is seen as a paradise to many other people outside of Europe who seek a better life.
But I'd like to clarify that it's the local people's choice if they want to open up or not toward total strangers (exception for the NPD, which makes up less than 1% of German voters, as they demand an unacceptable ethnic cleansing), that's what's called democracy and the sovereignty of a State. You can't turn every single German into a humanitarian from one day to the other. Seeing things more realistically, it's going to take more time for some than for others.
Peace out 
Réneise Francis
It is true as it explains the situation in Bautzen. This is one case that is particularly horrifying. But here these negative reactions towards immigrants are sadly the norm.
There is a conflict going on here fought out on the back of this young man and this is the first time he got a voice.
The hatred is not caused by the far right. The hatred is a reaction by many to the criminality and hatred shown by the left. The rioters were attacked because we are sick and tired of them.
Mar Di Paola
Horrible...

Antifa aren't Nazis, they're more like Soviets
Why do these savages go to Europe?
I'm not finding anyone addressing the fact that Clinton/Obama pushed the Arab Spring to disrupt countries living in peace. They fell like dominos . The middle east has been a hotbed of tribal wars for thousands of years. It will never end. The progressive globalists have pushed this refugee agenda that they in fact created.
Michelle Bray as I said this is one exception...sad as it is. I am in Munich and do not see the same reality which is why the media would be well inspired to present such situations as what they are: individual cases, then of course there is also the option of using proper channels for recourse...or move out of Bautzen?
When leaders like Erdogan threaten to flood Europe with refugees, what does that say? They use these people as if they were weapons of war. They are just pawns in a bigger chess match in which the Europeans are afraid to make a calculated and favorable move. "Send us billions of Euros or we will open the floodgates." Even Gaddafi said muslims could  take over Europe without a single shot being fired. They should actually help these people by assisting them in rebuilding their lives at home and educating them so that they don't have to flee to make something of themselves and in turn, make their own country prosper. But that probably wouldn't help the big $$$$.
Yes Anne Draper, it does matter and how.
You sound like you are filled with hate
Those countries are racist! They do t help anyone
Germany and Austria tried really hard.
Yes, there are racists, yes there are morons. Just like everywhere else.
But there are also people who are still trying their best, organizing help, teaching german, helping with every-day struggles they have.
we are not perfect, but America isn't either.
Because Germany is not helping them, they are just bringing some young workforce for the old population dying cities..

Manuela Twrsnick
I will tell you what Europeans really think: 
1. We welcomed them and realized that's it's a hard task, yes. However, we still believe it is doable. Thousands of Europeans have opened their hearts and homes, started donating, organizing events and helping out where they could. That is the main resource needed - kindness and love! And we still have plenty of this to give! 
2. I wonder where you get those numbers from? Rapes have not doubled! Of course there have been incidents, but how many incidents have there been in the US?!? In Germany non of my friends have had to make any experience of this kind - not even after the "invasion". Rape numbers in Sweden are high, but only because the majority gets reported. Numbers of rapes in the US would certainly double if the same percentage of women actually went to the police. And btw.. You must be quite naive if you think that women in the US are not seen as objects.. Unfortunately this is often the case all around the world and not only in Islamic countries 
3. We already have had the Islam in Europe before the "invasion" and it is part of our culture and lives - same way as Christianity, Buddhism or the Jewish religion is.. Europe has always been a melting pot of many different cultures and everyone can choose what to believe in. In my opinion religion always creates tensions and many times hatred and problems. Look at the situation in Myanmar, where the "peaceful" Buddhists are killing the Moslems! And Christianity as well is not the guarantee for love and peace, indeed it's stories are at parts quite violent and women are everything but equal! Just read the bible.. 
4. How do you know what refugees really seek? You have no idea of what those people went through just to get the chance of living a peaceful life! Their past, customs and identity are everything they have and still the big majority of them is happy to learn and adapt to the European way of life - it just takes a while.   
5. The real problem in our society are people like you! What makes you, an Italian living in Texas, any better? If everyone thought that way the world would be such a horrible place full of envy and hatred. You should be ashamed! People, open your hearts and make the world a better place!
yeah :\
This is so sad

You have a way too flattering view of the West. Which makes sense, most people view their backgrounds more favorably. 

You should get mad at the US and Europe for pushing economic and war policies which created this refugee crisis. None of these people wanted to be refugees. They became it as a consequence of Western plutocrats and bankers quest for control over resources and profits.
Thanks Susanne. So true. White supremacists and their fear of the "other" are ruining the world!!
It is mindsets like yours that hinders our evolvement. We can have harmony and equality. It is possible, real and beautiful. It starts with our acceptance and compassion.
Because our own teens would totally "act more rationally" when placed under same circumstances? They wouldn't flip, break, or turn out jaded, angry, lost? Heck our kids can't even handle not having iPhones like their classmates, and start running away or rebelling.

Tief, erklärend, erschreckend, weckend. Interessanter Bericht und Dokumentation welches einen spielerischen Umgang mit der Flüchtlingsthematik (ein Theaterstück) bietet.
Dennoch bleiben diese junge Männer, und das zeigt diese sehr gute Dokumentation auch, egal wie sehr oder wenig diese versuchen sich zu integrieren, eine gesamtstaatliche Problematik. Dieser müssen wir ALLE uns annehmen. Und das, so ist meine Meinung, wie es jede und jeder kann oder halt möchte.
Denn am Ende, das ist mein aktuelles Bild in Deutschland, ist jedem sein eigenes Hemd das nächste. Dabei gelten "Probleme" die sehr nahe, direkt und/oder persönlich sind, genau diejenigen die das Bild malen.
 I'm glad not everybody is hating and that the majority (I believe) is welcoming! And the theatre workshop is a wonderful thing! Should have shown that to the dutch guy..

I see your point but shall we talk about how Europe raped these so called immigrants countries?europeans invaded them and we know how it played out.
Europeans invaded America, Africa, Asia and Oceania for centuries robbing, killing the natives, putting them in slavery and taking all of the fortunes from or lands. You imperialistic politics has literally created the wars that refugees are coming from so you have the responsibility os taking them, because your countries have made their horrible, you have the money because you robbed from your colonies.
And you must keep in your mind that during the first and Second World War America has welcome millions of Europeans refugees. 
The sustainable growth you want, you have robbed from the rest or the world their chance of having it, and the European lifestyle from the last century was literally paid by the developing and underdeveloped countries riches that your imperialist and colonialism policy robbed from us .
WHO are YOU New York Times to have the impudence to paint a picture like this about Germany. I would advise you to start with your own country first!!! Maybe you should start and take in millions of refugees... oh well but why would you?

That is right Alexander, it is planned in advance with the specific objective to influence the electorate. Imagine if it were the other way around, against mass immigration, preservation of german cultural values, that would be "rascist". The newspapers fullfill the needs and wants dictated to them by a small, liberal, leftist oriented group. It is a divide and conquer agenda.
Neil Mo You got that right. That is fear mongering of people with conservative brain structures. White supremacists do far more damage than the so called islamic terrorists, but the media doesn't put a spotlight on it in the same way.
It's funny because Malaysia is accepting refugees but no one wants to come.......... I guessed the refugees prefer European countries......
Alejandro Ándale Cae SarPhilipp MaschnerPaul MüllerPhil More

I deeply apologize for the hostile filtering, you've gone through. We all filter. I don't see competent drivers on the freeway, only the ones that may be higher risk. People don't see poor people on the street, only people that look like our coworkers.

Jessica Thomas OK, I'm generalizing because that's the majority of the people that are refugees.  Obviously, if they  were successful people of means, and educated they wouldn't be in the position they're in .  Ignore the obvious if it makes you feel better.. But allowing people into ANY country that don't share common values and social norms is a recipe for disaster..
The New York Times: please check the facts! "Almost 2 mio refugees came to Germany in 2015" is not true. 890.000 refugees came to Germany in 2015 and 321.000 refugees came to Germany  in 2016.
That's bloody  prop! New York Times, you're disgrace even for MSM!  This is #fakenews!
Rosario Beck-Rey  refugees are being given a chance to live their lives away from violence and starvation.  We have people here from all sorts of cultural and religious backgrounds. Our country is founded on immigrants. During the 1970s we took in thousands of refugees from the Vietnam War.  They have gone on to contribute hugely to our society.  I expect people who are coming now will do the same. We have issues with homelessness and unemployment, too. I don't think any country on earth is without those social problems.  Doesn't mean we have to stop helping other people.  I'm not sure what your point is.

This video is American propaganda.  The reality in Germany is very different.
Jessica Lauricella Mills Christianity is from the Middle East.
I like how you take Bautzen as an example, which is propably one of the worst places in to live as an immigrant Germany.
The majority in Bautzen has recently voted the AfD, which is the political Party in Germany who is closest to right extremists as you can be as a Politician.

But hey, we don`t wanna be fair, we just wanna show you how bad the World is...
Obviously if you are in Germany for two and a half years and you still don’t speak the language “but you have problems with the nazis and the police” because the NY Times told you to say so in this interview, you cleary do not belong to Germany because you are having problems to integrate, there are more then half a dozen neighboring countries to where you are from that speak your native tounge and your integration would have been effortless...

That's the point, they want to have a religious core formed within Christian countries. Whether religious or not, Muslims will always be supportive of other Islamic, Shariah Law governed Nations.
When you let millions of refugees in your country, you don't get integration or assimilation, you get takeover -

Und wenn jeder der Flüchtlinge bei uns, eine auf ihn angepasste Einzelbehandlung nach seinen Bedürfnissen einfordert, fährt der Zug definitiv gegen die Wand.  Hilfesuchende sollen notwendige Hilfe erhalten! Aber Deutschland kann nicht für die Versäumnisse aller Staaten, Kriege, Diktaturen und Finanzhaie die Lösung und Abladeplatz globaler, religiöser und ethnischer Probleme sein - ausgetragen auf den Rücken der vielen ehrenamtlichen Helfer, die noch die Zeit und Nerven besitzen, sich uneigennützig, neben eigener Probleme, um die Angelegenheiten anderer zu bemühen! Wenn man den überflüssigen Haufen von 700 selbstverliebten Abgeordneten und deren 100.000de "Mitarbeiter" aus dem Bundestag entfernt und die Bezüge streicht - hätte man schon viel Platz und Mittel gewonnen.

I'm not sure who my people are that you are referring to, Julia. I also was unaware I had the power to stop invasions. Please explain to me where this power I have is because if I could I would totally get people to have educations that lead to jobs so they can lead stable lives instead of starting wars. As far as I know I'm a poor artist with a farm trying to educate people about the realities of agriculture and cross the urban/rural divide.
I would appreciate you not telling me what I'm apparently tired of.
if you cant think just blame Europe just like newspapers do

I live in cologne Downtown. That day you are Talking about, 30000 People demonstrated in the City against the AFD. It was a Great day for democracy! I whished your Friends had joined us!
87% did not vote for AFD Last sunday in Germany. 
In the west part of germany the AFD is much weaker then in former East Germany.
Its all not that simple to explain. 
We in germany have the same right movement like the USA and the other EU countries. We all have to try to turn back this Bad movement. 
And I know nobody in cologne Who thinks differeny then me. We are shocked about the hate vote. Especially men from East Parts and poorer areas in Germany.
Living in Germany beeing blonde and German I can assure you: most people did not vote right. Most people still like it to be helpfull in one of the many private initiatives. We wonder why government does not use that helpfull potential to empower integration.
It was a bit under 900.000 asylum seekers, not 2 million. You should correct that asap.

Also, I agree that the growing right is a huge problem, but I still fear this video does not pay the necessary respect to the thousands of professionals and volunteers which do their best to make the newly arrived feel like they're part of the German society.
Cemil Ögüt
I never asked for them to come. In fact I, like millions of others screamed to be heard, but was ignored. Now it is obvious that we were right, yet we are the ones who will pay for the mistakes of the political class. Europe is ours, not some cake to be divided among the world's peoples by ideologues who did not bake it
how does a baker in stuttgart have any influence on what country NATO, the USA and the UN decide to bomb next????
Jessica Lauricella Mills  spend a week or two as a volunteer in one of those refugee camps and we should see how fast your naive pink bubble bursts. ‍

Let the truth be said it's true not all places in Germany are racist but for the case of Bautzen don't even dare defend the town I went there just for a visit but regret accept that Bautzen is a dark part of German with narrow minded people coz people were running away from me and children crying coz am black i had never expected this in civilised country like Germany so don't dare blame the refugees that they are not angels and don't dare support the hell they went thru let facts stay facts
890.000 refugees came in 2015, in 2016 numbers went down to about 400.000. By the end of 2016 the total Muslim population in Germany was 5,7%. So not nearly enough to call it an "invasion". rape cases have increased but not nearly as doubled, a minister of Bavaria, Joachim Herrmann, misspoke on that matter and has said so himself.  Most rape cases by refugees were among refugees, which doesn't make it better - but the narrative of refugees being out to rape German women is too simple and not true. Also I wonder who exactly is starting a "culture war" here
We are all Abode...
That Abode is a stubborn guy. Why is he drawing police attention as a black guy. And did they deport him back to Libya?
Sanya Srivastava ugh
Wait a second, this is something that is happening in Germany but only in a few cities in the east. They have been condemned by the rest of the country and the rest of the country rallies against this kind of behaviour. The difference between what's going on in the US and this is that we don't have a leader who justifies this kind of behaviour, but actively works against it.
Alex Gornov
Thank you @marie francis
Screw you NYT for your one-sided video. You conveniently forgot to mention about New Year's Eve 2015 in Cologne, when around 1000 migrants mass harassed/brutally groped hundreds of women, when savages brought  they're Tahrir square to they're unsuspecting German hosts. Cologne was just the tip of the iceberg, it happened in other German cities the same night as well, although in smaller numbers. So don't you dare portraying East Germans or conservatives as right extremists or even Nazis! 
FYI: we had many refugees ~25 ago in Germany because of the war in former Yugoslavia. But those refugees weren't causing any problems. If you see hate growing it's because of too many bad apples among nowadays migrants, nobody appreciates a bad attitude and misbehavior.
Why don't you go back to serious journalism instead of this one-sided feel-good crap?
Speak for yourself. Some Europeans still welcome them...

Ok, looks like our Senate better get back in there and make it a 650 billion dollar military budget, rather than a 700 billion one. Our infrastructure is already horrendous, given the weather we've been getting lately, putting that much into military upgrades is tom foolery. Oh wait... the whole world hates us and we need to be ready, I forgot.

Me sorprenden mucho las preguntas y repuestas de los periodistas de CNN Español por sus comentarios de la manera que se dirige el presidente Trump al líder norcoreano, Kim Jong-un; que es un demente Kim Jong-un ¿sí? Es un LOCO y me justa el tono del presidente Trump y lo dice con mucha valentía, con mucha firmeza e indignación de un mandatario contra un asiático Loco Kim; con los ejercicios militares con bombas nucleares que afecta el cinturón de fuego del Pacífico, que nos está destruyendo el mundo con terremotos, tornados y viene lo peor maremoto con terremotos continuos

Really,James P Harris? If I served my opinion matters, and if I didn't, no? Many of those serving right now see no other way out of this economy,  moving forward. The rest are patriots fooled by war for profit. 15 of the 19 men in 9/11 were Saudi and we hit Iraq.  I'm proud to have not served in this war for profit,  and if you did, I'm glad you made it out alive.  Your government could care less about your ignorant patriotic life.

I know ARF was active there.
University is not a place for Comey, “university” is made of “uni-“ and “-verso”.
Were the protestors trampled and arrested like they were in St. Louis?
What exactly was the point of this demonstration?
Poor guy can’t catch a break
Policing black communities shouldn't  be something people should protest.. what they should request  is having  a diverse group of officers in their  neighborhoods.. you can't  have a bunch of white cops policing a black community thats a recipe for disaster.. but people  should  stop viewing the police as the  enemy  because they are not the enemy.. the gun men killing entire families and recruiting young black kids into gangs are the real enemies.
So much for free speech and the intelligence of the youth.
That's okay mueller time....remember Nixon.....
Have you watched the video?  It is clearly stated that these protests are about his comments about policing in the black community
So some Howard U students disrupted Former FBI Director James Comey speech. Ok but like or dislike him, he will go down in history as the man that SAVED America’s Democracy by STARTING the investigations against Trump, Manifort, Flynn, Kushner and the rest of the National Treason Party! 

Comey is my homie!
He got a tastes of his own medicines
I think it would have been better to ask him about it and try to hold him publicly accountable. Sometimes I feel like protests miss the mark.
Greatest what exactly? 
The man handed trump the presidency. Trump fired him for thier disagreement and frankly he didn't need him anymore.
Destroyer of a nation!
Sessions is not doing his job. How can we have trust in a government unless those who have broken the the law are brought to justice.The only crimes committed was when Comey obstructed justice by conspiring with Lynch and Obama to protect Hillary from prosecution for conspiring to disseminate classified information to Sid Blumenthal and to cover up Clinton Foundation pay for play using her State Department position. The email server and destruction of evidence under subpoena was only some of many crimes she committed.

He understands..
Because Comey threw the election? Free speech is one thing, but disrupting another's right to speak is not - same thing that happened with Nancy Pelosi. The protesters spoke, but would not let her reciprocate, as they chanted what their leader read from a script. You can protest a speaker, but when you drown them out, it's crossing the line of your free speech impinging on another's.
What a bunch of fools
Here goes a conversation starter:  Why did you feel the need to make a public statement regarding an aid's (Huma Abedin) emails to Hillary (which you knew was nothing) immediately preceding the 2016 election when you clearly had substantial evidence the Trump Campaign was conspiring & colluding with Russia to undermine the U.S. electoral system?
Ok, but I completely understand their point. They're talking about his previous racist assertions related to criminal justice in black communities and that was not acceptable. I just wish they would raise the concerns in a way that actually facilitated a real dialogue that could help us move forward instead of merely shouting him down.
That's called doing his job. You need to choose your homies more wisely
Totally agree. Community policing is a really effective way to build trust between officers and the community, and cities can start but having a more diverse police force. Removing policing entirely only creates problems in the long run.
Lock him up!
I didn't see that, I just heard a bunch of chanting. I did realize they were black students.
 it ! Comey is my Homie!
All lives matter
How odd that he would have been invited.
Thanks Comey for handing the Presidency to Trump even though you had been investigating him DISCREETLY since the Summer of 2016 for possible collusion w Russia!
Aaron Jeffrey Your's doesn't!
WHY DOES HOWARD KEEP DOING THIS?
Idiots
Probably sent in by the Trump people.
that guy is a total disaster, would not do his job, just played at it
I'm so glad I left the US...
This seem like a good way to hand the next election to dotard trumputin...
#Fake Russian Trollbot
trump must be just as proud as punch of these "protesters"...  little do they know what awaits them with the 'trump effect'
He cost Hillary Clinton the presidency. He cannot undo what has happened since. We could have had a true president
Steve Lloyd ..you talk like a nazi saying people's lives dont matter.. disgusting !
Still waiting on that evidence
It seems the Howard University students forgot the message from Barack Obama's magnificent commencement speech last year at Howard.  President Obama admonished the students that while it is all well and good to "protest," none of it counts if you don't actually participate in your democracy.  I'd like to know how many of today's protesters sat out the presidential election last year.
Is that your well-reasoned opinion?  Or is it the dogmatic babbling of an individual in total cognitive surrender?
The age of discourtesy and lack of respect continues. No matter what happens soon there is a situation doubling down on everything negative. Cursing Comey in a vile manner- why? Because he didn't do what you wanted? If Loretta Lynch came to speak would these same people act the same because Lynch's meeting with Bill Clinton precipitated Comey's involvement?
He’s not of friend to BLACK PEOPLE he’s been rejected, so have you. 

Mahmoud Qotz , I would have liked to know what comments they didn't like.
How can it be a conversation starter when you've set out a hypothetical not supported by facts?
Alan Hill friend of yours?
What a bunch of morons
I was going to say!!!....I think we owe him!
You really have to wonder why Obama refused to investigate so many matters related to the election even though they were brought to his attention?
Doesn't take long for trolls & Putin bots to enter.  Lol
Protesters are dumb shits. This man has done nothing to have this happen to him. Protesting is a huge waste of time no matter what the cause or reason is.
This is not how you get your message across.  This is not how you gain support for your cause.  I agree with Maureen Callahan.
Julien Maxime exactly.. I think  a lot of people  keep missing the mark on the real issues affecting these communities.. I think a lot black folks automatically  view  the police as the "bad guys" and have this deep hate for cops, when the police really aren't  the problem in my opinion.. these neighborhoods  have a lot of uneducated  people who have turned to a life of crime and violence, So l  think when you add that with all the guns available  to the gangsters in these neighborhoods  and their hate for law enforcement most cops who police these same black communities are in fear for their lives..  things will never  change until people start trusting the police and seeing more officers  that resemble themselves in their communities.
Mahmoud Qotz  No matter what Comey said or did right before the election, RUSSIA had already swayed the Election. Please follow the investigation facts: Trump et al worked with Russia to win election. Russia used cyber warfare and espionage to put Trump in WH. Comey did not do that! Place the blame where it lays. Trump/Russia
I find it odd that HU would invite Comey to speak at their commencement. However, I'll admit that I'm a little amused by how clearly uncomfortable he is on that stage.
Wasn't aware Comey had some agenda against black people?  I think people just like to chant and protest for no valid reason sometimes.  The fact he was invited there to speak means a good number of people wanted to listen to him, and to just drown him out in chants for 15+ minutes is idiotic
Obviously a bunch of idiots period.
He was invited.  That makes him a guest.  Please, a little civility.
Nevada Smith So communities should trust the police first? Some enforceable publicly debated ethical standards would be part of this I hope. Body cams that stay on. Limits on weapons.
Amazing how so many persons effecting some level of education are so clueless on real facts. From Obama's gross negligence regarding problems related to the election, to Loretta Lynch's gross negligence, to Comey's mishandling of the entire situation. Darn, no wonder Trump got elected.
That be hashtagged like for real! #Comeyismyhomie
Agreed
OR, he will go down in history as the man who felt some odd duty to tell the WHOLE WORLD the FBI was taking just one more look at Hillary's emails while he somehow forgot about tRump and every last soul associated with him being under investigation for every earthly sin under the sun! Nope... I'm inclined to feel a bit sorry for Comey, but I ain't mad at these students.
Ok now why are they protesting this guy
Julie Umek Yes people should trust the police.. how can you expect help from someone  you don't  trust? I'm  a black man so It's  not like im against  black people.. but this anti cop thing isn't  helping  the black communities  and the police isn't  the problem.. the gangs and drug dealers are the problem the robbers and rapist are the problem. The police can't  do their job if no one is willing to cooperate with them.. and when they think you hate them they're  automatically  on their guard  against you.. but if you work with the police i think  there can be change in my opinion
Like Comey or dislike him with respect to his political leanings, I believe that he is one of the few true American patriots.  He is not perfect but he should never have been removed from office.  I like the sentiment behind the protesting but I personally find it not useful.  There are plenty of other people that it would be more useful and deserving to protest .

And with respect to everyone saying he handed Trump the presidency, I genuinely believe he was just following crazy investigation leads and made a mistake by making the leads he was following concerning Clinton public before he finished his investigation.  I know he regrets it and he is no fan of Trump if one actually follows what he said during the hearings.  He knows Trump is not competent enough to be president and that his incompetence is dangerous.
So proud of these young people at my alma mater.
This is only question worth asking. Comey threw the election to a Traitor.
dumb
Comey is a good man
Give the lad a break you rich kids who think your above the law...spoilt little shits !
Gee, another Deep State Sellout is interrupted (yawn)
He destroyed the chance of Dems getting a majority in the senate, and some seats in congress :-(.
"Clearly had substantial evidence"? Your statement is without any support in the public record. In other words, you're making it up. There may someday be evidence in support of your contention but not right now. If you really wanted to start a conversation: Despite evidence presented to him of serious irregularities and possible foreign interference in the election process Barack Obama decided to delay any investigations. When Obama finally acted his steps were fairly insubstantial. Was Barack Obama grossly negligent in his performance of the duties of president, or based upon his analysis of the evidence did Pres Obama conclude allegations of outside interference in the election process were likely false?
Comey will go down in history as the man who's meddling almost destroyed democracy in America by putting enough doubt on Clinton that it gave Trump the edge.  His violation of Justice Department policy on staying silent during election periods is the enabling factor that started all of this.  The investigations into Trump should have been initiated years ago by the State of New York.
Rod Scott  Explain how he is not a “Friend to Black People” what factual evidence do you have on that?

Morons are white people.
Laura Ahearn Meyerson I doubt anyone is a Russian anything. In fact, the whole similarity to "Commie!" is sickening. 

Anyway, the gentleman makes a point about Loretta Lynch. Her conduct was inexcusable and the (no pun) lynchpin of everything which occurred related to Comey.
Rod Scott Yo, disrespecting a sista and one raised in South LA by giving me the finger in foul. If you disagreed, fine but all that was disrespectful. Yet, Comey is not a friend to blacks. You just showed how you are not a friend to a black woman yourself. 
Bass Mainer  omg you are so racist and intollerant
Denise La Lande respond to the substantive comments, not the obvious baiting.
The villains are Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton, yet they get a pass while rather unintelligent kids act out. Loretta Lynch should be the person on the dissection table, yet...
Randy Meier you do understand that Russia interfered with the election by dropping voter rolls, disseminating propaganda, manipulating factual information all the while working with Americans to put a puppet in the WH. There was nothing at the time that Comey could have done to stop that. So yeah, blame him not Russia/Trump.
"Civility" has become as unknown to most people under 35 as "Civics".
You might want to check out Ken Burn's documentary (ongoing) on the Vietnam War before making a comment like, "Protesting is a huge waste of time no matter what the cause or reason is".   It seems the Anti War Movement was pretty successful.  You may also want to check out a little something called the Civil Rights Movement, Ghandi's Salt March,  The Boston Tea Party etc etc etc
Do you prefer “good manners”?
Mila Boyko No, that would be Loretta Lynch. Maybe she's up for an honorary degree despite her improper conduct and stupidity?
Let the man speak!!!
Of course he has regret, as he should.  He violated policy.  He didn't make a mistake.  He intentionally violated policy.  What makes it worse, there was nothing there.
Exactly,  he should feel nauseous about that, dems lost the momentum on grabbing few more senate seats thanks to Comey
first of all, protesting IS participating in Democracy, why would you assume they don't or didn't vote? Seems a weird assumption to make
Bunch of Idiots ss Usual
Ugh. Pick your enemies more correctly, please.
Wait, what? they were *protesting* Comey? WHY????
It seems you all have never heard of Co-Intel. Google it. Like I often say, the dumbing down of America is complete.
Melissa Mears please clarify the substantive comments: lots of posts here. what particular points would you like for me to address?
Debra Morris Exactly. The dumbing down of America is complete.
Pretty bad when a protest has to be accompanied by subtitles. I have no idea what they were doing, but I guess that they had the right to do so. After all, THEY weren't graduating.
Comey should be standing before a judge at his perjury trial instead of in front of an audience at Harvard...   He blatantly lied to congress... MULTIPLE TIMES and yet, Our weak kneed Attorney General HAS DONE NOTHING.
Mahmoud "handed Trump the presidency." lol Jesus Christ dude you don't really believe that right?
Well, he did help 
get the 
man-child elected.
Barry Gauthier 1) there was no justice policy. It was a practice. 

2) Trump has been on the NYAG agenda for years however this current crisis has to deal with the Trump campaign and its working relationships with Russia to win the election. That nexus was not discovered until earlier 2016.
And if our president is any indication the over 70 crowd is not doing any better with civility
Being in university and being ignorant and rude, sad....
Uhm. Why protest this? Makes no sense.
THAT IS A CONVERSATION AND WHY THESE DISRESPECTFUL KIDS ARE ALLOWED TO DO THIS IS BEYOND ME, IN MY DAY THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL.
Debra Morris Because 75 million didn't vote.
They were Russians disguised as students!
No the dumbing down was complete when millions DIDN"T VOTE...

These hateful and misguided democrats should find a safe space to reflect on their inexcusable behavior.
Yeah I am not either. why they are shouting here? I dont remember anything racist that Comey said or did.
You can never tell if these Facebook profiles are real or fake, I say fake.
Marilee Murphy  Naw to be quite honest I really do thing protesting is a huge waste of time today. 
You are quite right, your comment nicely backs the fact that some good can come from protesting. I, however, do think that other methods could have been used to obtain the same results. I'm literally saying that most of the world needs to get one on page and decide what is important. We have some very greedy people running the world. Protesting won't move their hearts because money always will be #1. I would have put my prior statement in a better, more conscience statement had I not been at work but the brunt of the idea was that protesting doesn't really accomplish anything in my own observations.
Hey check it out.  Flip it on Obama and show bias for Trump.  Awesome...  whataboutism....
Marilee Murphy I suggest that protesting is a much better option than bombing or killing someone or some entity. But that seems to be a much more attention grabbing headline these days. Ghandi's salt march was brilliant, but what LASTING good has come of it ? In the long run, everyone is just bloody nuts.
Remember the part where Mitch McConnell allegedly threatened Obama not to act?  So it's not so easy to pin as a one-sided affair.  Anyway, ymmv.
What a great example of both sides exercising freedom of speech peacefully.
Scott, specifically what evidence is it that you refer to?  I still haven't heard of any and I pay attention.  Thanks.
Ankit Agarwal He's literally made of cornbread.
I'm not going to make a judgement one way or the other on your conversation starter, Scott McCullom, but here is what I think his response to you would sound like:

He had a legal obligation to inform the Congress about substantive developments in the closed case, and did so. It was *Congressmen*, not him, who leaked that out knowing it was right before the election. And finally, the investigations involving T and the rest were at that time barely beyond their infancy; what is known today was not known then, and even now, Mueller is not finished getting to the bottom of it.
Ignore Skip Klauber.
Comey was the head of the FBI. Do you know anything about the FBI's history with black Americans?
Crooked Comey a famous person who declared Hillary innocent before interviewing Clinton and evidence.   Of course him and Hillary are above the law.
A more objective point, Alex Bramsen.  Much appreciated amidst many other threads and unfounded comments...
Preach, Denise!
Oh my God this poor man is standing the darkness.. Seek the light.
Seth Weber so he has to be held accountable for the actions of every corrupt cop?  Comey has been a pretty admirable/honest person
Good
Let's face it, Comey screwed up big-time. There's no good explanation for his actions.  He has behaved patriotically at times, like when he rushed to Ashcroft's hospital bed to stop some anti-American Bush/Cheney ploy.   But the impression of an occasional bumbling idiot remains.  Mueller seems a bit more focused.
Actually they brought great shame to a great university.
Good! Maybe he'll learn there are other Americans, that aren't white!
Where's the confused emoji?
I'm sure you dont live in the hood....but ur a expert on fixing the hood..mmkkkay
Obama was in a no win situation.

On one hand, the GOP and their supporters were painting Obama as a potential Dictator. So anything Obama did would have been seen as a power play for the Democrats to regain power. So he did nothing.
Rodrigo Miranda well they were painting President Obama as a dictator...when trump actually wants to be a dictator
You're a moron.
They protest because it's an available venue with an audience.

Wanyetta Cert-Mua McIntosh I never claimed to be an expert.. and I dont  know if my theory  would work.. but it sure do sounds like a hell of a lot better plan than whats happening right now. Should  we just continue to accuse every single cop of being racist? You don't  think there's  a lot of issues that black folks cause on our selves? Can i ask you a question.. Would you trust  me if i went around telling everybody  you're  a racist  and you hate me?
Robert B. Dwyer if that is being addressed to me, why the insult? Just disagree. I disagree with other’s options and respect them without debasing myself with insulting them.
These people who are protesting Comey are literally protesting the wrong person. He’s not the problem, the problem is the top republican leadership and the trump administration. Terribly misinformed students. I really want to know what their motive was to interrupt his speech and what they hoped to accomplish.
Oh I feel so sorry for the poor fascist
It's history, after decades of abuse of trust the police need to earn it back. It might make people begin to start trusting them again.
It's ok to not agree with someone but extreamly rude and childish to do what the students did.  They need to grow up.  When they get jobs this type of behaviour will not get them anywhere except unemployed
With what was known or speculated by September 2016, the new leak of email’s from Weiner’s laptop forced a re-examining, re-opening of a closed investigation. Why? Because that is policy and must be known to public.

When the investigation was concluded on the new emails and no crime was done, he also informed public. His last statement exonerated her. He was suppose to do that. 

Nothing he did or should have done by oct 2016 would have changed the results.  Russia/Trump machine had already won.
Appears that Comey is nobody’s Homey.
Democracy doesn't work for us when we do vote. Last time around was a choice between trump or Hilary who thinks people like me are super predators. Vote for who I ask?
And let's not forget, the GOP constantly said Obama wasn't "strong enough" when he sanctioned Russia and took away a couple of Russia's Compounds in Washington DC metro area.

And to the point of how messed up this all was, one of Trump's first orders of business was to remove the Sanctions and give back the Russian compounds.

There is soo much smoke, but some refuse to see ANY of it...
Nevada Smith I’m not an expert either but police are supposed to serve the community, not the other way round. People would have to step up and take responsibility for their own communities, and work with police. This isn’t the same as cooperating as in obeying. A lot more changes would be needed than just attitude.
Daniel Phillips you can't  expect the police to put faith in a community  that demonize  them.. imagine  if you're  putting your life on the line and the same people  you promise to serve and protect go on protest every day to protest you? There are always going to  be some bad apples.. but to just use a brush  and paint all cops as racist or the enemy  is just wrong.  If people start Cooperating with the police the police will do a better  job helping those same people  who need them.
Unemployed corrupted loser trying to make money on brainwashing the youth.
That may be true Denise La Lande, but you do realize that there were a lot of people who thought there was an interesting timeline there?  I'm not saying Comey did that on purpose, but it certainly gave some the impression.  Anyway.  Best wishes.
Julie Umek ok so if someone commits  a crime and no one is willing to be a eye witness  how do they expect  the cops to do their jobs? People  in the inner cities Rob  and kill  each other then the police show  up to help and no one is willing to cooperate, so the officers have no other choice  but to hassle  people they see hanging  on  street corners, what else can they do? There's  this culture  of not "snitching to the police"  but who does that benefit? 
Imagine when theres a killing and the police go to help and no one is talking.. are the police suppose to magically  know what happen? Then when it becomes a cold case these same folks say "the police dont care about black  people" but no one talk about the fact that no one want to be an eye witness. I'm  sorry i just can't  agree with you on this.
You weren't there, you know nothing about the issues, yet you seem to think your opinion matters. It doesn't.
He probably wished there were some curtains to hide in.
... But also tanked her election hopes by announcing they were reopening the investigation a few days before the election.    If he was in the bag for Clinton he sure had a strange way of showing it.
Naw they dinnae
I seriously wish people would not disrupt.
You do NOT know if/how these young people voted. FoxNews is probably telling you they did NOT vote. You are being misled.
Denise La Lande, please cite any credible source for any evidence that "Russia dropp(ed) voter rolls". Maybe you could start by explaining what that statement even means, since it makes no sense whatsoever. As to disseminating propaganda or manipulating factual information, that was and is going on, with the help of social media, in particular, Facebook, via a multitude of sources both inside and outside of this country on a multitude of things other than just the last presidential election.
The FBI said way back in 2006 that white supremacists have infiltrated police forces all over the nation. They looked at the issue again in 2013 and found that it has gotten worse. What we're seeing are modern day lynchings in America. 

You're dreaming if you think you can just ask your local police force to hire some minorities and hope the problem goes away. I come from a law enforcement family. Ask me how I know.
Like or dislike him, this was very rude. He wouldn't be there but someone from Howard invited him to speak.
Nancy Miller and you're assuming it's these students?
Eric Suarez stereotyping?
Robert Alfonso my opinion matters as much as yours.  Have a wonderful day
Lou Carr crime and violence  will  never go away, innocent  people getting killed  by police will never go away.. it can be reduced tho, and you can reform the police system. All cops aren't  racist. To say that is misleading  on so many levels I don't  even know  how to reply to that.
And nobody shoots, right?
A bunch of obnoxious jackasses.
He’s also the guy gave Great Orange Leader a glide path to the presidency.
Joey Lange 1) the Dirs of CIA, DIA, FBI and former AG all state the fact of Russian tampering. 

Please review the most updated information on all things related to Russia and the election. Whether you disagree or not, this site is very detailed, in facts, of the current information.

https://investigaterussia.org/
Mark Drury please review this well sourced and well documented site regarding all current information and all current investigations.
Joey Lange https://investigaterussia.org/
They're exercising their first amendment rights here -- this is democracy in action.  Sometimes it's too icky for someone like you, I guess.  So what makes you think they didn't vote?
They knew Russia was interfering, they had no idea to what extent. No one believed trump would win. It's so easy to judge with hindsight
Sorry, folks. I think that was disrespectful. You should've had dialogue with campus officials and leaders about the choice for speaker. if a majority had expressed their distaste early on, perhaps some other speaker may have been agreed upon.
Why bother giving a speech to a bunch of nigtards anyway? They don't understand English. ;)
And on the flip side you can't ask communities to trust an organisation that routinely fails to sort itself out or deal with there issues. The bad cops are rarely called out for their behaviour the culture of behaviour of bad etc. It's a chicken and the egg situation
Sorry Denise. My age and some bad experiences with prosecutors have made me a little grouchy. I just am grossed out by the #resistance exalting terrible people for doing a mediocre job opposing Trump at some point (thus Bush becomes a cute grandfather from Texas, Comey an outspoken advocate against government abuse.) As bad as Trump's optics and ideas may be, this crew played a far larger crew in twisting America into a corrupt racist warmongering state etc. etc.
Ok guys, how is this impacting commerce?  Your message is already out there but this achieved nothing except making you look exceptionally ill-informed & undisciplined.
I guess they wanted Hillary convicted too
Bob Archer, it is not too "icky" for me.  I am a veteran of many a protest march.  I do vote, I do participate in my government and that includes running for elective  office.  When all you do is protest and not otherwise participate in your government, the protests are meaningless.  That was the point of Barack Obama's  speech at Howard last year.
Why?!!!???
Agree  don't boo/sing VOTE!!!
He's the reason Trump got elected....
Robert B. Dwyer I think you for your civility. I agree with you to a degree. There are so many factors that has brought us to this current state that pointing fingers at one does negate the others. 

I don’t believe Comey is an advocate for gov’t abuse. He is a guy with principles and integrity that tries to do the right thing. He admits his judgement was askew but seriously, he had the republicans in Congress down his through about the email when he finds out Trump maybe working with Russia to win. I do not envy him.
Justin Lanoff I’m so sorry you believe that because that is not factually true. Russia is the reason Trump won. Today otherwise gives Russia the  win.
Brian Anderson bump
The man at least tried to undo his mistakes.
What were they protesting? Sometimes you gotta wonder where Wisdom has gone. God deliver us...
They protested because the FBI has not been fair to black communities
Hana Chaudhury Tina Hai conflicted
You don't even have to be a Republican to be sick and tired of all this protest bs. Some people need to get their heads out of their behinds, find jobs, and start making real changes in the real world.
Dileni Weerakone if stupid could fly you'd be a jet
Nancy Miller 75 million who didn't vote?
Julia Whitley Holcomb To my point.
Jordan Kian Smith "not fair" is a generous statement. Americans need to exercise a little intellectual curiosity and learn US history that is always white-washed away from textbooks, but it's documented. May I suggest inserting "CoIntel II" in FB's search box or google it, though Google algorithms hide a lot. USA is exceptional at structural and systemic racism.
Thank you Scott McCullom. Well said.
Chris Paige
Except he went on national TV and announced it. Without telling any of his superiors first.
When else have you ever seen that happen? 
Skip Klauber RUSSIA TRUMP RUSSIA TRUMP RUSSIA TRUMP is to blame. No one else!
As for 2016 voting statistics, 50% of all eligible voters voted (~165 million, with HRC winning the majority of the votes by 3 million). 48% of college students voted, which means less than 50% of all voters were grown folks. (#MathMattersToo) So, again what 75 million and who exactly to whom are you referring?
He will go down in history as the FBI director who interfered in a presidential election resulting in an incompetent boob getting elected.
Please are so disrespectful. 
Let the Former FBI director Speak.
Beckett Rueda
He will go down in history as the FBI director who interfered in a presidential election
He will go down in history as the FBI director who interfered in a presidential election
I'm aware of what evidence has come to light about this matter to date. My question is simple. Two parts: what do you mean when you claim "Russians dropp(ed) voter rolls"...and what credible proof do you have to support such a claim? The fact is you have no answer. You should really stop attempting to claim you know something more than you do. It's ridiculous.
They're people not, black people. Why do you assume they are protesting racism ? Why don't you try to find out what they were protesting before opening your mouth.
Pamela Quinn because they chanted "we love being black!" And accused him of racism(which they didn't even really convey in their chant.) Jesus Christ
Good, this traitor doesn't deserve a public space to spew his lies! He should be kissing Trump's feet that he didn't throw him in prison where he belongs for letting down the American people with his handling of the Clinton investigation.
Well maybe the protestors need to pick their battles. OR they could lose their supporters amongst the rest of the population. I know he is not your "homie" but he is respected amongst most Americans, especially in hard times like right now.
It wasn't commencement,  it was convocation.
Mark Drury 1) facts regarding Russian hacking and alteration of voter rolls. Well sourced...

https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/4828306/russian-hacking-election-widespread-private-data/%3Fsource%3Ddam

Mark Drury  and here

http://www.salon.com/2017/06/22/report-election-hackers-stole-private-voter-data-altered-voter-information/
You are protesting the wring dude
I can't believe that you believe  that Russia helped TRUMP  win the Presidency. WE the people VOTED TO ELECT  TRUMP. WE WERE STANDING IN LINE FOR HOURS TO GET TO THE VOTING  BOOT. DON'T  YOU BELITTLING THE  VOTES OF AMERICAN PEOPLE. SHAME ON YOU. RUSSIA  HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. HILLARY BRAIN WASHED  YOU PRETTY GOOD.
We wouldn't have needed the investigation if he hadn't thrown the election to the orange menace in the first place.
I wish that white men who hold positions of power understood that conversation doesn't  neutralise power.
Of course trump supporters would never admit they were played. The Russians knew who to target and it was right wing dipshits.
Short term memory problems?
Stuff like this is why so called "liberals" make so little sense. The enemy of their enemy should be their friend. If these "liberals" could form strategic alliances with people like Comey and disgruntled "normal conservatives" like him, in order to counter the alt-right extremists, Trump would've been isolated and politically neutralized, like Marine LePen was in France. But NOOOO - they have to be like anarchists, and protest anyone who doesn't share their ideology!! Trying to unite the left and middle in America is like herding cats!!!
More fascist tactics by the leftist snowflakes! How about letting people speak and you respond! DUH!
Because Comey and 90% of mankind thought Hillary was going to win....
Oh the protests are valid, alright.
Fair game, I say.
Comey was Dir. of FBI and couldn't have "started" the investigation against Trump or Russian meddling.  Someone hirer ordered the investigation: https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2016/12/09/politics/obama-orders-review-into-russian-hacking-of-2016-election/index.html
Meh. They can do what they want.
Ba ha ha the stupid is strong with this one. DERP
Mike Klein they can do what they like but you don't have a right to drown someones voice! That is a fascist tactic! DUH!
What a shame.  I think Comey is a good guy.
DERP ALERT
89% of Americans can't find North Korea on a map. Go USA.
Scott McCullom this was after 2015 Manifort’s wiretap and the June 2016 dossier that was the catalysts to the entire investigation.
And he smiled, paused and carried on like Most GROWN ups do!
Scott McCullom FYI a review is not an investigation. How do you think Obama got the info about the hacking? He received a report from Comey and Clapper. The president can not order the FBI to investigate anything. Separation of powers.
Denise La Lande -You mean Clapper.  Comey (FBI) don't investigate internationally.  FBI may work with a foreign entity to apprehend a criminal.
Scott McCullom  please read this definitive timeline of all known events. The criminal act of the Russian Hacking took place in the United States thus under the jurisdiction of FBI. Clapper as the firm Director of National Intelligence coordinated all info from CIA and FBI and open this FBI opened the counterintelligence investigation as well.

http://www.factcheck.org/2017/06/timeline-russia-investigation/
Denise La Lande - my point is James Comey did not launch the Russia-Trump collusion investigation.  The ball was rolling prior to reaching his desk.
Skip Klauber    It’s “affecting” Dr. Klauber.
Scott McCullom Did you not read the facts I posted. Seriously? The President can not order the FBI to investigate anything just as the president can’t ask the FBI to stop an investigation. 

I understand that you want to hold on to your position about Comey but is your position so ensconced that even facts are discounted. Facts matter and facts should shape one’s understanding of events.
Rebecca Stoneham Gladu  the investigation into Russia started in July 2016 before the election. Even if she won, the Russians interfered and THAT is the problem.
I think the point of a protest is to be heard. Fact that a speaker was disrupted and media covered the protest = the protest made their point. Going on further in protest is to say you don't want to or care to hear the other side. Every one has a story and wisdom you can learn from, even from your enemy. Leave egos at the door.
These people are feral.And thankfully completely unemployable.No one will
have to tolerate them.Which means
more jobs for the students not yelling
You Ain't My Homie! like just complete
slum trash.
You guys know he is on our side right??
someone mentioned history of the FBI with black people. Might it be possible that following generations of all racial groups think differently from their ancestors? i.e. can it be possible that an FBI chief ten years from now is Vietnamese, Indian,  black, white and has different prejudices than the FBI chief 60 years or more earlier?
No matter what he did before, showing respect to others is always something important. Comey is a good director and he started the investigation into Clinton's Scandal.
Kasson
Traitor
Gilberto Mancini No, 95%, including a very unintelligent, arrogant and grossly negligent Barack Hussein. Long before the Summer of 2016 matters were brought to the attention of Prez Obama. He did nothing. According to former WH aides Obama did nothing because he thought it was in the bag for Hildy C. I'm not sure what his believing HRC would crush Trump has to do with the need to investigate interference with an American presidential election-? Really, was Obama arrogant and dumb or did he doubt the intelligence reports put before him? 

As long as you give people like Obama, Holder, Rice, Lynch passes and waivers because of colour and political affiliation you not only completely undermine your credibility you work to ensure continuing Republican victories.
Jamie Wilson You're absolutely right. But if you & your cohorts think the proper manner to deal with Trump is to continue lowering the bar of courtesy, respect and decorum you play to his strengths. Again, do you and your political coreligionists not understand the key role they've played in normalising Trump? It's been a 25 year process and Demz, libs and alleged progressives still fail to realise the effect of creating precedent.
Alina Kilpatrick
Denise La Lande The investigation should have started long before this time, but Barack Hussein stopped any attempts to do so.
Campuses are becoming intolerant places. Shouting down regular people is not bloody activism!  That is bullying! I have no interest in hearing the opinions of the disruptors!
Ultimately my overriding thought about this story is the students ought to be a lot more concerned about the academics at Howard. It's undergrad is not ranked in the top 100. Howard's law school is not ranked in the top 100. Howard's' medical school and business school are simply unranked, meaning they are rated as quite poor in quality. HBCU's have declined precipitously with desegregation but a few schools (Howard, Morehouse, Spellman. Maybe Fisk and Tuskegee) very much deserve to survive. This can best be done by increasing endowments and a plan for doing this might be to close all of the marginal (i.e., virtual high schools) HBCU's and direct financial efforts into the handful of schools which might excel. This represents a tough and very emotional decision but until something along these lines is pursued schools like Howard will remain in decline or holding at mediocrity.
Because protesting the former FBI Director who was fired will get you somewhere 

Listen up!

Way before his stupid letter to Congress, he talked up the Ferguson Effect - that increased scrutiny of policing in this country caused an uptick in the crime rate.

...and provided ZERO evidence to support that claim. 

Howard is a historically black college
Welcome to Bolshevik students .Free speech is now forbidden Like good little Communist .
Good post.
What jerks... demonstrate outside
Of course they did.
I hate when thugs shut down free speech! Listen then voice you're question or concern!
Minorities always
Hillary would have been President if it wasn’t for Comey. Screw him.
Rare Trump clarity called Comey a hotdog or such for the limelight.
Sounds childish to me.
He is still the man that brought us Trump by unprofessional,unprecedented and inappropriate behavior toward Trump's opponent.
Yes exactly. His unprecedented unprofessionalism cost us a qualified president.
Denise La Lande " ...known to public?" No just no. When police stop you and run your license is it made public knowledge?
And what good did it do? Only thing they accomplished was being disrespectful to the people that wanted to here what the man had to say.
Nancy Miller you go girl
Kimberly Bacon
He comes with a few issues, but I still like the man...sorry the speech didn't go well for him.
The ignorant protesting the corrupt!
Why didn't he prosecute Hillary?
Sooo glad Trump got elected maybe we can put an end to the establishments corruption!
Not allowing people to speak leads to you not being allowed to speak. 
Plus comey is 1 of the factors that lead trump to be in the Whitehouse
I understand their need to protest, but what is the point of disrupting Comey's speech? Good message, wrong place, wrong time.
we're all about freedom and democracy here! Guards! remove these disruptors!
Skip Klauber explain how the investigation should have started long before it was started in July 28.

FYI: please review the Obama era investigations regarding Manifort and his initial FISA warrants as well as the various banks that the department of justice that by Eric holder in the state of New York have sued and put sanctions on due to their relationship with Russia. No president before Obama today no president after Obama!
Booooo!!!!! I would have walked out! That guy doesn't deserve to be there!!!
What he failed to do was tell the American people about the Russian investigation; the same way that he did about the email investigation (btw-there was nothing)! Awful choice and I most definitely would have walked out!!!!
The dumbest group of protesters you'll ever see
Stand tall Mr. Comey (no pun intended) you have more supporters than protesters! 
Not a great fan but that was just plain rude. He responded as a competent, educated person. They carried it to far.
Black??
Brown people work harder
Who are going to work harder in flooded texas and Miami to reconstruct?? Please respect hispanics
Protesters are NOT " dumb shits" they are people who want to be heard and feel their voice has been ignored. I think this particular group went too far and were just rude. Protesting for what you believe in or against tyranny and injustice are the hallmarks of a democracy.
Mr. Comey has a lot of explaining to do, now that it has come to light that the Trump Campaign investigation was well underway before the election.  Why the selective and public chastisement of Hillary, but not a word about Trump's business" partners? This man is partially, if not wholly responsible for the mess we are in now.
Sure.  He "started" the investigation.  Then he turned the Presidency over to a complete and decidedly un-American miscreant, who has populated our government with know-nothings, charlatans, and worse, collaborators in the destruction of our democratic institutions.
I wish they hadn't done this! His move 11 days ahead of the election changed the outcome, but he's going to be important to the investigation against Trump. Leave him alone!
Denise La Lande Wow, there are so many problems with your whitewash. Set aside how Obama received reports as early as 2014 or that I was advised in 2015 by one of my kids about shenanigans of docs appearing (he saw on Wikileaks) or the wet noodle reaction in July of 2016 regarding the DNC emails. Did Obama do anything serious or launch a serious investigation? According to testimony by a former secretary of homeland security Obama was weak willed and ineffective. Obama did nothing of any import until a few weeks before he left office. "Unwilling to act forcefully" has been the common description from intelligence sources of Obama's conduct since 2014. And level headed Democrats have agreed Obama was what we in the real world would call negligent or irresponsible. Did you miss this coverage in the Times and elsewhere in June of this year?  

Try to imagine your opinions if it had been Trump ignoring intelligence reports, being described as weak willed by intelligence sources, and exposed by his former DHS as doing nothing until it was too late. Obama and his team (esp Loretta Lynch) were bozos who if you're correct about foreign interference very ably assisted Hildy in suffering the most astounding loss in the history of US presidential politics.
Mary Louise Markle Your hypocrisy is showing. Where were you worried about democracy when King Obama decided to rule by decree in a manner unheard of before his term? Oh, Obama's totalitarian streak was fine because... he's a Democrat? And on these FISA warrants and surveillance, what would you say about a Republican Admin that wiretapped the campaign of a Dem candidate for president? And the unmasking of private citizens by Susan Rice and... our UN ambassador?? Mueller s tactics of breaking into homes and leaning on people by threatening prosecutions which would break them financially? Yeah, sure, I'm sure if the acts were against a Dem you'd have no problems. 

The hypocrisy of your supposed concern about democracy is rather stunning.
Angela Saucedo I have found that people have been misinformed regarding the Emails and Comey so here it is:

Hillary used a Private server and not the .gov that she should have used, per FBI Classified IT policy. Remember she is not the tech director, someone else made that decision. That incident happened in 2012 and the investigation started in late 2014. From the state department investigated and determined some classified email were transmitted by the private @gmail.com server. Out of over 50,000 emails less than .001% were classified and sent through the private server. Because the private server broke policy the FBI had to determine, investigated for almost a year that Hillary broke policy but was not criminally negligent. Comey made that statement on July 5, 2016. Repeat, Comey states she was careless about not following policy (IT guy took a deal), she had done nothing wrong.

Then good old Russia leaked that there were possible more unreviewed emails on Weiner’s computer. On October 28, 2016, In a letter to Congress, Comey said the FBI is reviewing new emails related to Clinton's time as secretary of state, according to a letter sent to eight congressional committee chairmen. THAT WAS LEAKED TO THE MEDIA. Thousands of email had to be cross referenced and not a week later, Comey states again that she has done no wrong.

So explain to me how he gave trump the election? The Russian/Trump propaganda machine was in full effect way befor October 2016. Whomever leaked the email Comey sent to the 8 congressional committee leaders was the one who through a wrench. Let’s hold Russia and Trump responsible and not a cop who was following the law. 

Also you do not tell the subjects that they are being investigated for treason so making a public disclosure in August 2016 would have been unwise.
Skip Klauber I agree on some of your points about Obama admission being forceful but remember, he has no power of the investigative powers of the FBI. He can not make them investigate anything. 

Not sure about investigations on Trump/Russia in 2014 but I do know Manifort has a 2014 FISA warrent issued and the Obama Administration’s DOJ money laundering unit was very busy shutting down some of Russian laundering banking. 

Yet he is negligent and irresponsible for what. Not being able to see into the future that a candidate for president, an American citizen would commit treason and espionage, violate federal election laws, deceive the public and work with a foreign government in a widespread cyber war to win an election!!!

JJ Abrams could not have written this BS.

Can you please post the information regarding the former DHS stating Obama was weak?
Skip Klauber I thought when I first read your post that we had different view but facts mattered. However I must say this post shattered that. There is a real cognitive disconnect between reality and the world shaped a View that obama is the real problem. You can post here till the cows come home and I will not engage you further.

I can discuss an issue with someone who works from a factual reality who seeks dependent inquiry but someone denies facts and assures their perspectives as factual, there is no more need to discuss. I’d rather be productive and share facts that get upset by an ill informed troll. 
Pretty much all of them. Black people are the reason trump won battle ground states like Michigan, and went on to win the whole thing
REMEMBER COMEY ,,,, NO ONE WANT TO SEE YOU ,,,, NO ONE WANT TO LISTEN YOU ,,,, SO PISS OFF , AND NEVER COME AGAIN ,,,,,,,, IF YOU WILL TRY AGAIN ,, THEN YOU WILL BE SLAPPED ,,,,,,,,
I feel like politics is always in the air. And sometimes, idealists may confuse what is right and what is practical, and double down on hoping their choice is both the same way bad FPS players "spray and pray" in hopes of scoring a kill for their team. But just like a bad gamer, sometimes they do more harm than good - and in the best case scenario, their actions will have no impact at all. When you make demonstrations, protest what is worth the attention of the public. Or else, you'll risk alienating the very people who you need to drive your movement into a revolution.
James Walling Gandhi's salt march was one protest/step if you will that was a part of a larger process. Of gathering the fervent support of a massive populace. And it would ultimately drive out the regime and get its people independence without significant violence. So these well publicized protests were significant to his cause.
You forgot the investigation on the crooked Hillary*
Why is the KKK , racist? But, BLM isn't??
But before he did all that he got him elected!!!!!
John Santos  Do you understand the timeline of the events? How could he have done “all that he did” to Get Trump elected. I am not understanding u?
I would have liked to hear a clearer message in that protest, and I would have liked see Comey actually invite them to share the stage and carry out that conversation he mentioned, instead of just wishing. There was a good opportunity missed.
Sigh Sammy Lau
What happened...?!
Oh...... hmmmmm
Jordan Kian Smith it's wild how everyone goes off topic of the issue. Odd...
Fired Comey has nothing to with who did and didn't vote in the presidential election. No one is questioning the reason of the protest or a guy that has admittedly influenced the election, then admitted leaking information to the press, but freshman students protesting are the problem. Really strange...
So welcome to Trumps America where anyone on any side of the political spectrum will either not be allowed to speak or will be shouted out if they do
Well deserved.. supported the orange leader and got fired when the Russian connection was too big to hide..
He also manipulated information being disseminated about the stupid email investigation right before the election.
Comey has won me over, but his comment about a conversation is ludicrous!!
When did you, Comey take the time to find out what these young black peoples lives are like & work towards a better Justice system for them?!?!
Crickets... Never!!

It's time to show some respect to them & it's time for you to put in the work to change the Justice system for blacks in America!!!
But he also brought down HRC in the 1st place, had he not done this he would still have his job & he wouldn't have had a hand in installing the Nut job in White House
Victoria Pol how did he bring down Clinton? The FBI exonerated her twice. The FBI did not start the email issue. The Republicans did in 2015.  And in October, It was the Republicans that leaked that the FBI were reviewing addition emails from Weiner’s labtop.
Ok finally the protest group has been explained...so how long ago did he say this and what context?
Or he tried to talk and they didn't bother to listen. Totally obnoxious as he is not their enemy - there are so many other really racist people they could be protesting.
One of the worst things about America... Haoqian Zheng cc Sharon Stovezky
Wonderful...fantastic.  I do not like Trump...don't like his guy either...self righteous misguided civil servant.
I admire him but he sure screwed Hillary.
He had a chance to have a conversation a long time ago but chose not to have one!!!  Go back under your rock and disappear.
That's what you get for ruining our Presidential election.
Denise La Lande Your troll language is unacceptable hate speech. Sorry you dislike diversity, I guess we can all try and think like you. In the post Bill Clinton era of "no responsibility and no blame" I guess you fit right in. It's Obama's own folks who say he muffed things. Matters were brought to him & Obama decided not to do anything. Obama took no truly serious action regarding foreign interference until weeks before he left office. Why? Maybe he was negligent, maybe he was distracted, maybe he doubted the reports, maybe he was weak. The fact all you can do is cite actions against a private citizen which if done by an (R) you'd label fascist in nature is pathetic. It's nice to see how the neo left have all become huge fans of secret courts and secret warrants. Real conviction there. 

Try judging facts and circumstances w/o propping up different standards depending upon if someone is a Dem or Republican. I find such sliding morality and ethics repulsive and the primary reason we now have president Trump. "Oh, he or she is a Dem? Then it's OK to be a corrupt scumbag". Then you think people will line up behind you when you identify a Repub who is a corrupt scumbag? I guess you've not caught on that doesn't work but you keep up the hypocrisy and see where we get. You're clearly one of those people who decided to pull out all the stop to defend everything Bill Clinton & Hildy Clinton and then just couldn't understand why revelations about Trump being rude, discourteous and crude made so little impact.
Denise La Lande no one knows... but I think you r wrong.
Majid asli Harvard
Corrupt criminal
Comey showed his grace by accepting the invitation. I find him to be on much higher plateau than the protestors. I feel like apologizing to him for this treatment! What I know is that he's a tough person and we have not heard last of him.
Visited the wrong area?
Merkel is decimating the indigenous peoples and culture of Germany for the benefit of the old and wealthy. Its truly amazing.
I'be talked to a German today and he never once spoke about any of that. He spoke of her awful austerity policies which are ruining Germany not taking in refugees.
Emily Hall this is worth a watch.
What a bunch of lies!German are nice to refugees its the refugees who are not nice to them!Lies lies!!!
Who is The Germans?

Interesting to read about  "indigenous people" from  Americans.
Nico Gorgas
Don't worry - you can come to America, we have lots of room and America helps people - Like our Statue of Liberty says; "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore"  Oh wait no, we are not about that anymore, I forgot. We are just about walls now.
Danielle Dias Silva Girz
Luckily he isn't in america. Americans don't wanna help anyone else anymore and he woulda been killed by police well before 1 year in country.

Stay in Germany, where I hate to say it, is the new leader of the free world.
LoL yes. The indigenous people from America, amazingly, aren't pure white people. 

The shock!
Sure it goes both ways.
We are so blessed to share this earth together at the same time, I wish we could learn to come together in love and support for each other.
I am from Poland. Yes this is the indigenous homeland of Europeans.  You sound like a racist agianst whites. Europeans are not manic or special, they come from Europe.   I would be careful as you live on land stolen from the indigenous people you slaughtered
Thio Cadam
Feel free to sponsor some refugees, on your dime. Put your money where your mouth is instead of volunteering the wallets of others.
Beware of the Russian trolls
Racist against whites? That's not a thing.
The majority of Germans are nice and go out of their way to help refugees and foreigners.  A vocal minority, including one of the political parties in this election, is anti-Muslim and anti-foreigners.  This is because they feel they might lose something.
I do, I pay taxes and I am fine with spending it on helping people. Thanks for your feedback
Toni actually it is, better grow up
You're telling me to grow up?  You're that special kind, aren't ya?

So timmy boy if you want to start can you show us some reliable sources on that? No right wing nazi you tube videos this time please. Unless of course you are too busy stealing german cars and trying to sell them in poland. Before you say it more criminals cross into germany from poland than from germany into poland. It may not look like it but i kind of missed you.....boy.
You can learn to be German and stay true to your Heritage 
Both can be accomplished 
Take your rightwing spasms back home. You're embarrassing yourself
Who exactly are the "indigenous people of Germany" that are being "decimated for the old and wealthy"? Usually, they are the same here...
Farewell Europe you had a good run :(

Nick Timothy Knight Let's see your scholarly knowledge on the situation, i might be wrong. I know i started aggressive but from the past you have only proven me right, every time. Where are those sources? Not showing any sources and deflecting will just prove your ignorance anyway.
Dawid, I have posted many many mainstream articles. I do not even read right wing garbage. You live in your own world, with a fantasy reality.
Taulant Sllamniku
Not our problem
We have 55 million people living in poverty 
Another 60 million living off the government
We need to take care of our own poor, weak and disenfranchised 
Don't get me started on the number of homeless veterans
Gabriel Mijares
Luckily, we have Congress to write the immigration laws, not a plaque at the bottom of a statue.

And how many refugees are living in your house right now, Christopher? I would hazard a guess that it is zero, and that virtue signalling is your main purpose.
i hope 4 the best ROMEO MY ROMEO
The irony of a Pole being concerned about ethnic Germans!!
Nick Timothy Knight Your main stream things in the past worked against you because you either only read the headline or were too lazy to finish the article. Deflecting, try again. That is reality
Hila Azadzoy thoughts??
I watched full documentary wow... that’s so sad hate see Adobe been go through of haters. Praying him stay strong!!!
Very sad.
Problem here is that some entity caused him to leave Libya...hmmm. Wonder what entity was the cause of the overthrow of my homeland? Can any person who is of good integrity answer this truthfully. Hint: "The United States does not have permanent enemies" -- said, Condoleezza Rice, How permanent is DEAD,  Muammar Gaddafi?
Marina, if the Germans were just decimating themselves it would not be much of an issue, but Frau Merkel is attempting to spread her disaster to all.
John Snape You are absolutely correct. I have no refugees in my house nor do I plan to have any, that however has nothing to do with my comment.
Yes, there are racist people in Germany. And yes, there are people in Germany who don't want refugees to be here. But there are a lot of people who welcomed them and are helping them integrating in German society right now. Ist it so hard to understand that there's not THE German? 
We have the same problems that other societies have. I'm tired of these "inner nazi" comments. 
I don't like those nazi scumbags and yes there is a problem concerning racist people in this country. But don't forget all those people who tried everything possible to help and still trying.
Nick Timothy Knight Tell you what, i'm going to do something completely senseless and give you time to maybe find something so take your time and READ the articles this time before you post them. You might get it right this time and not make yourself look like an idiot to the world again.
I have already shown you ridiculous fool how many times. I told you, that you have no idea what you are talking about. German after German told you the same thing. . You  just start rewriting history now. How sad are you.  I told you after the third time of you shutting down, it's over. I am wasting  my time.
Correction: You are a young, black man, lost somewhere in Germany. America wouldn't be your cup of tea either...
So, you are saying that this person had none of these things happen to him, and you know, because you were with him everywhere he went? Not all Germans, or any nations' people are bad, and racist, but there are some who are. Serbia, according to your rant,and Germany now, nor ever has had a leader which espoused hate, ethnic cleansing , and racial bigotry.
The government still plays a role in whether people get into the country overall so he's not making a moot point. Also, only about 10% of the federal budget goes to safety net programs. 24 and 25 percent go to Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid/CHIP/Marketplace Subsidies, respectively. A variety of social service programs are funded heavily by private contributions from businesses and individuals. The 10% here covers everything from SNAP, refundable portions of the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, SSI, school lunch, energy assistance, childcare assistance, etc... so it covers a lot. That's not counting state, of course, which acts as a supplement to the supplements, if you will. Either way, were it not for these programs the poverty rate in the nation would nearly double.
Racism knows no borders.
Gene Gomes you must be a native Aboriginal American from a registered tribe to even say anything negative about the effects of immigration in this country. If you are not native Aboriginal American than you are an immigrant in this country. This is a truth that must be learned.
Distortion of facts...complete bs
That might have been true in the 19th century but things are different now.
One of the biggest if not the biggest party is trying to ride the anti-muslim hypetrain, so its a pretty big minority
The problem while the majority of refugees are good people and just want to live in peace, their is an element within their ranks who hate us and want to kill all westerners.  The terrorist attacks in Europe are becoming their new normal, and yet no one is interested in doing anything about it. The refugees have no interest in adopting a whole different culture, why should they they have their own rich culture? They end up in mini communities. Their needs are met but nothing else. To most it must feel like they are living in a Red Cross enter waiting to go back home. Anger grows and then they become prey to recruitment. These are truths that we should not to continue to ignore, believe i go not they would rather live in a safe Syria then living in Paris, London, or New york.
Nick Timothy Knight, your grandparents were more than happy to decimate ethnic German population...not just the Nazis, but farmers, women, children and babies! Mobbing and lynching and raping the ones who were trying to get away! Understandable, sure, somehow, considering what Germans did to Poland...but strange to see you concerned about "decimation" of "ethnic Germans." Seems to be a bit unpatriotic of you.
Yea, cause Wall Street stole all the money, and now the con man donald is getting his share.
"new kind of hatred in Germany" ?
Poor Abode. He should have stayed in Libya.
The party doing that is the AfD (Alternative for Germany).  They could receive 10-11 % of the vote, maybe being the third strongest.
What, Marina poles where the ones decimated. However, I do not want to see that happen to any ethnic group now, white, brown black or otherwise.
And, you are suggesting that those people who come from places where other countries exported wars to should just stay, and hope not to be bombed by the western countries, and our alliances? Just tell them to hold still while I bomb you, and your children?
We care, trust me Abode (y)
Nick Timothy Knight You cannot seem to find anything real to back up what you are saying, or are too lazy. Thank you for admitting that. You have shown your ignorance and your lack of credibility in what you are saying. You have shown that you are no more than a nazi troll, you had the chance to try to change that. Again thank you for that, it hurt for me to lower my IQ to talk to you on your level. I'll give you your peace for now, until next time. ^^
And then there's that issue of 7th century religion that claims women are second class citizens and available for rape.  And abuse of children and animals. Germany's kindness has been repaid with violence.
No group that treats women as second class citizens will be welcomed by me.
Germany is a terrible country. The Nazis didn't arrive and then leave 45 with an UFO.
Excuse me but you have no idea how much intelligence and deportation policies are being carried out in Europe against Islamic terrorism. Many terrorist attacks have been prevented, many Muslims have been arrested, Salafist mosques have been closed, many radical Inman has been prosecuted, we have many open operations against illegal immigration in the Central Mediterranean Sea, which have been very successful, closed down the Balkan route, the agreement with Turkey stopped the flow of refugees to Greece to. We have also adopted very aggressive deportation policies by signing important agreements with third countries to admit returnees. What do you understand by doing nothing?
The awful truth is, opportunity is limited. The economy’s limited demand for rather unskilled labor force is a harsh reality and not racism.
Elena Roldán And yet it is their new normal, the idea that they are preventing attacks is not acceptable because there will always be those who will won't be stopped. You miss my point, most refugees just want to be able to go home to their lives and are not in love with western ways, some even offended by them, which is their right. Too many assume that given the chance they'd embrace the west and never go back
Mark Bustamante You do realize that the United States as a nation was added to the world  after the birth of Jesus, don't you. Let me simplify this for you. Does not make a difference when you add the sugar, the drink will still taste sweet. Can you understand that? Or, Should I take it a little slower?
Unfortunately I fear, there is much truth in your statement!
BS
Taulant Sllamniku that's definitely not true as you should know since you live in Munich.
At the end the NYT says Top comment is selected so some comments filtered out. Whoever wrote that obviously cant speak English properly. Cant you find English speakers nowadays?
But most important what does ^filtered out^and who does the filtering out? What ^filtering out ^really means is CENSORING AND BLOCKING comments .
Eliana Mallory so interesting !!
So where is my comment? ^Filtered out ^ I suppose...How shameful...I know America is now a broken junkyard but really to censor comments that are not using fould language or are abusive....What a fall...!!!
You say helping them which means helping women...I dont see any Muslim women here, talking to German  men and women.....indeed if any Muslim woman did that her husband or father would slap her face so hard half her teeth would fall out
Especially because i live in Munich, i know that the CSU/CDU is muslimbashing. Thats a given fact
Heinz Frey AFD and CSU/CDU unfortunately
Some in CSU, not in the CDU (Angela Merkel has spoken out strongly on that).
Wait, why aren't we letting these refugees pour into our country like Europe.  Oh yeah, because we don't want weekly terrorist attacks like Europe.
If you calmed down a bit, you might be able to write English competently. And make a comment relevant to the article.
Racism at its best! Will it ever end? Doesn't anyone have any compassion for these poor unfortunate people to have had to live through some horrible events? All they seek is what we all seek / happiness & a chance for a good life!
John Wu 
One has to be a special kind of lunatic to deny there are racist idiots in Germany. Because there are, I live there. Some of said idiots are most probably gonna be elected MPs in a few days, sadly.
Christopher Quereau please provide your full physical address complete with directions so you can do your part
Salvatore Wonk does that come with a complimentary talking snake and magic apple?
I'm sure you're personally dedicating your life to fixing it. I'm sure you're willing to pay higher taxes to make sure it get done? Because I am. I'm wiling to help any person I possibly can. I don't care where they come from, I don't care what language they speak. Let's make a deal, you work on homeless veterans, I'll work on refugees. Each person deserves our help. Each person deserves a home and a life with hope and acceptance. We don't get to choose who deserves happiness, we can only try to bring it to as many as possible, instead of hoarding it all away for ourselves.
You mean Christianity, right?
Facebook filters out top comments based on an algorithm. Please calm down. I'm genuinely worried you might overreact into some kind of injury.
If only these refugees realize who is giving them a place to call home..
Uhm...Merkel destroys the ethnic and cultural identity of Germany, forged in the heart of Europe in the last 3000 years. Arabs, Turks, Blacks, Afghans, Pakistanis, etc., have not been part of Europe.  The extinction of European peoples is assured, and will be irreversible by 2050. What emerges is a non-white people, rooted in the tribal societies of Asia and Africa.  This is the death of the West, the end of the European peoples, and the beginning of the egemony of non-European peoples.
Jessica Cooper I deleted my responses. I feel pity for you.
In the documentary he says that he saw how nice Europe is and wanted to come. It didn't say that he was victim of persecution. The whole of the Middle East and Africa sees that its nice in Europe. They all have TVs and Iphones. They all want to come to Europe. Hundreds of millions. There's no end. Is Europe willing to have them all? Would Europe be the same? Answer this question without worrying if you are called a racist.
Mahdi, racist elements are EVERYWHERE, in case you hadn't noticed. And they are not going away for good ANYWHERE. Such is the human race. At least, the Germans are trying. Why single them out?
I'm sorry Gabriele ,better believe I have the utmost respect and admiration for "die mannschaft". I meant to say ,no matter how much good they do , they're always reminded of the little bad . 
They do not want to integrate.That is why there are Muslim zones all over Europe recreating their old countries.661 in France alone.
Hatred always has it's base as fear.
Tamara Brown
Why aren't countries trying to help solve the issues in these countries so people don't have to flee their homeland? Wouldn't that be proactive?
Dont worry Ms Cooper!...I am an elderly Englishman who has about two million words of lengthy political and social analysis on the worlds leading newspapers..I am probably the writer of the longest comments in English online in the world. In fact in 2011 I wrote  lengthy  comments in both the NYT and New Yorker where I had worked at the best British style school for expatriate children  aged ten to eighteen years .I pointed out then that   if the CIA succeeded in destabilising or destroying  the Westernised Europeanised socialist regime of Gaddaffi,I would not want to be in Britain when the bombs started going off.  Most of the bomb suspects are Libyan refugees who ^escaped^ from Gaddafis socialism and are all essentially religious fanatics. They are known to the intelligence people who do nothing to block their actions because they are in a way American/UK heroes (like Ossama Ben Laden..remember him? found and funded by the CIA to destroy socialism in Afghanistan)
Rebecca Chavez i could write a book of terrorists acts committed on american soil by Americans. Refugees are the least of my worries.
Continued..Nowhere in this ^documentary^ is there any attempt to ask these Libyans what kind of society do they want for Libya..Did they support socialism or religious fundamentalism? The Arab world can only go forward with socialism or it will go backward to seventh century religious fundamentalism.America is dedicated to destroying socialism anywhere it finds it. Now you have the result. The way the western media NEVERask any questions about the people they are supposed to interviewing is utterly shameful. In these civil war tyle conflicts EVERYONEhas a view...so why cant the media find out what they are?         Incidentally MsCooper,just what are these ^algorithyms^ structured around..? Im sure we would all like to know...Cheers !
I meant I had worked at a British style school in Libya for children of the expatriate elites there
Sa Le
You mean that some backward people are afraid that they could loose democracy and freedom under Islam ? How strange that. :)
Strangely this clip doesn´t say if poor Abode actually has a valid claim on asylum. Just to claim to "flee violence" is definitely not  enough according to the  international agreements. He has to prove personal persecution and the burden of the proof lies solely on him. As for the integration - this is first and foremost the duty of those who come and ask for asylum, not of the receiving nation.
Idiots
Is very simple to resolve. Back to your country.

If they come unskilled, then they'll get funneled into apprenticeships where they learn skills.
The birth rate of Germans has now plummeted to a rate that won't sustain our country in the next couple of decades...we need migrants more than we let on
Maya Oppenheimer the theory is good. But reality does not go so smoothly. There is also a limit on how many you can bring up to speed in apprenticeships etc. Immigration is needed. But the illusion that everybody, regardless of background, will land a job has been debunked.
Don't worry europeans are idiots and don't have children in years black people and muslims going to be majority
If you want to help him send him back home . Germans didn't leave Germany because of the Nazi , they got rid of the Nazi, Liberals are raping the worlds country of their production people , It's easy to take over a country if first you displace all it people.

This is clearly a false message. I am Swiss and the refugees brought many problems to europe. Rape and drug trafficking are part of everyday life. In addition, they get a house, food, sickness and social welfare free of charge. it is simply not fair for people who have worked and invested their whole lives. Think of it...

Exactly
Unfortunately not everything is what it seems. Politicians are actually taking advantage of the situation and as it is normal for them they are taking from the people. The political parties are not willing to donate anything and the governor of Morelos a State that was closer to the epicenter is actually stopping trucks arriving with help from other States and keeping it on their own storage places but yes I agree regular normal hard working folks are doing their best to help.

Its so amazing to see how the government and people helping each other out....
if this is true it is very sad to hear, why must government be so blind to those in need , it seems the whole world is becoming so selfish, those with kind hearts are being over shadowed by the greedy

Amazing all pulling together , only in Mexico
Viva México y su gente! 
Prayers for Mexico n its people. Be safe.
The power of the people is greater, our government has been sabotaging our well-being since day one but for once it feels as if we're finally waking up.
VIVA MEXICO!!!!!

Philip Glass' music - in particular the string quartets and metamorphosis - helped me move through some incredibly challenging life circumstances. Forever grateful for Mr. Glass and his amazing contribution to the planet. :)
What a wonderful moment 
You are a genius and my absolute favorite living US composer. Thank you for your music and your talent. I have listened to you since high school.

Good morning from Bucks County Pennsylvania 
Like in a dream, I'm lying in a sofa listening to Philip Glass. Thank you so much.
Any plans for more movie scoring? I'm particularly fond of your score for The Hours and listen to it frequently (as well as your music from the Truman Show).
Would like to hear if Mr. Glass will be releasing his own version of the recording of the 2nd volume of his Etudes after already having done the first half.
You're considered one of the most influential composers alive. What do you think it is about your music that inspires so many others?
Listening in California!  Loved his first book , , ,along with the music...
Please come to Copenhagen :)

Hello from Sao Paulo, Brazil! How was your experience presenting in our city last week? I was there and, from my side, it was absolutely beautiful :)
I was a dancer and choreographer for so many years and I danced/made dances to his music. He is so important to the dance world both professionally, semi professionally, and amature dancers. How often do you choreograph for dance specifically?
What inspires you to compose? Do you seek inspiration from the landscape, art or poetry?
How is the process of composing for films and working along with directors/editors?
love you
Philip, I found a poster from April 12, 1983 - it's from a performance at Colorado State University - how was that show?
How is the process of composing for films and working along with directors/editors?
How many projects do you work on at a time? Do you try to limit this?
Will the stage production of Einstein on the Beach continue touring?
Please discuss your score of "The Hours." Inspiration, process, reception, etc.
I've been so taken with all of your film scores, particularly "The Hours." for which you were robbed the Oscar!! Could you speak about any upcoming film collaborations?
Zoé Vescia

The joy for what he does and the joy of collaborating just bursts forth from his soul and lends a charming sparkle to his eyes
You're such a versatile composer! Thank you from Tennessee!
Do you compose songs to films?
Does he need a Page-Turner?
Mr Glass do you think music is the best way for humans to explain existence?
Koyaanaskatzi was so prescient of the world we have now.
thank you for making such beautiful music. your Metamorphosis II and IV were the first songs i learned where i felt like i could express myself rather than just playing the notes
Heyy Mr. Glass!
Love the music, also hearing the composer discussing his work!

You are one of the most celebrated composers alive today. What were the biggest challenges you faced in getting people to value your music at the beginning of your career, and how did you overcome setbacks and rejection from your peers, classical purists, and society as a whole?
a gentlemen's honour.
This seriously made my day! Such a gift to get to interview and listen to great composers play their own music!

Amy Burt my Dad is a massive fan of Philip Glass, if you send him the clip he will be able to tell you all of the songs, and probably various "interesting" facts about them!

Victoria Burt yes! He's not on FB though! I've got one album called Solo Piano...so good
Thank you! So beautiful.
I've just sent him a screenshot and asked him if he wants to log into my account!

Exquisite and ethereal piece.
Never heard this piece, but I loved it!
You have such a marvelous tenor voice, I feel honored you replied to my humble request and pointed me to your music! I see more on You Tube and I'll be listening to more!
I'm not a musician or have degrees in music, but I love music! Hope to find some Mozart on You Tube. Happy to see you're  Mexican (I'm Puertorican and my hubby was Mexican) and I'm happy to have made your acquaintance even if it's on FB! Some of my grandkids are very musical and play drums, piano and flute! With so much tragedy in Mexico and PR, music is a soul soother! 
Sorry to ramble on! 
Shaná Tová
Again, thank you. Music really can bring people together, perhaps more so than other forms of artistic expression.

Rebecca, remember when we saw live interview with him - his answers were long  meandering and couple times forgot what original question was.

Too many chords! Lol!
Minimal....oh I get it
An amazing gift!

Might you tell us your experience in each note you play? The sound... what they make you feel?
HH the Dalai Lama says the sacred way of music might just be the rightful way of communication...

Please come to Rio de Janeiro! We love your work!

Saw Einstein on the Beach at BAM 2013. Haven't been the same person since
Thank you for
Thank you from Sydney !
Modern Classical music that sounds sublime? Thought it would never happen. Thank you. Hope for one of the most precious and flailing art forms.
Changed my life

Listening from Naracoorte in country South Australia 
Menakjubkan, bisa menonton anda main
Siempre hermoso y climatico su musica es un bellísimo viaje

Beautiful
I tried to do a rhythm by tapping the hearts....they randomize !!
Unspeakably beautiful

The music sounds the way light dances across rippling water...
I started to play piano without any theories; and usually they are minimalistic and emotional. I wanted to know is it better to learn the theory and play or let my heart and brain follows the passion and let the pure feelings decide for playing the keys? - thank you so much for these beautiful musics; I have been inspired from your musics specially The Hour..
Einstein on the beach again danke schaen
How do you think about a person conposing songs on piano without knowing a theory? Or is it necessity to learn the theory?
what inspired you to compose this work
Does theory matters in composing minimal songs? What if someone doesnt know theory and still composes?
Love Philip Glass
When you come to Glasgow Concert Hall or The Sage Newcastle, David and I will be there!

Listen to Philip glass for four hours in a concert and see what you then think. This work is not as austere as many of his pieces
Just one more way in which The NY Times enhances my life. Thank you!
Guido Lenzbach
I wonder if Alane knew about this concert. She has adored Philip Glass since she was about 10.

<3
Magic...

So inspiring.....

Great, so happy to SEE my favorite music such a great musician xx
If the heavenly realms have sound it would sound somewhat like this i believe

Why can't you write atonal or rhythmically interesting music?
Gracias hacer el mundo un poco mejor con tu música.
Mad Rush; a favorite piece of mine.    Love you Philip Glass! 
Masterpiece....takes you on a gentle wave so far away 
From Beijing with love. Mr. Glass.

Mishima <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/67Q4nHgj1oQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
Little piece of heaven..
So immersive & one of my favourite composers. I would love to ask Philip if he visualises anything whilst he plays?
Saludos desde Chile.
Why oh why can't I be at the premiere? I fell in love with his music when by luck I first heard "mishima."
If I could do that I'd never leave my home! Beautiful!
Philip G
Philip Glass, In your movie/documentary, you said that the music is already out there, you just have to write it down.  Those words stayed with me, still.  Can you speak more to those words?  Do you feel you tap into the future? Meaning, the future is already there?  And you just have to write it down?  Thank you.  
Brandon Ye
<3
Amée laat pap eens zien
Woooo
Michael Strand

WONDERFUL

Gracias maestro. Desde Ecuador.
Supra!
Fantastic
So amazing! Thank you for sharing!
How long did it take him to write this piece and what was the inspiration?
:)
Mr Glass, what goes through your mind when you are playing this beautiful piece?
Amazing, beautiful, estupendo, de tirar o chapéu . Thank you for sharing.
This brings tears to my eyes...-amazing...
I can't imagine we will have the type of budget that will allow a next time - unfortunately.
thank u Philip. thanks from Argentina!

Do you see colours or images when you write music?

Merci pour ces moments de pure poésie musicale!
Where do you go from here?
Gracias Philip
What do you see in the future for music? Evolving from what you contributed in minimalism...
Adam Cad
So magic !
Thank you mr Glass! Mad Rush accompanied both me and my wife's wedding and later the birth of our son:)
Is It Possible for Music to Have as It's Point of Origin The Very Exchange Between Action and Experience in a Particular Place?
I'm thinking of Grand Canyon; Machu Pichu; Pyraminds of Giza; Northern Lights; 
as much as in Certain Places & Events...
Auschwitz
Birkenau
Dachau
Hiroshima
Nagasaki
Twin Towers & Fall (2001)
Shanksville, Pennsylvania
Plane Downed by Hero Passengers (2001)
Mexico City Quake (2017)

In other words? Is the Challenge of our Time, in an Era of Global Catastrophe, to Hear, Feel, Experience, Write & Listen to Music which is as Much about being Impacted by The Earth even as The Earth is Impacted by Us in an Evolving Dance Movement of Relatiinship?
Dana Gust Carr did you see this?
Grande musica...
Lets go!
Beautiful!
Do you have compositions for cello?
so cool!  wish i was there.
Absolutely beautiful.
Your work is so full of movement and visual imagery. Did you work with artists from other fields?
Your music, Sir, turned me into a contemporary music lover
Mad Rush

I love your music so much.
The first time i listened his music was with in the hours movie after that i adored it
Bravo

Beautiful
Does Mr. Glass still reside sometimes in Canada? If so, when will he be hosting his next kitchen party and what kind of beer does he keep in his fridge?
Love you 
Tully Olson

So lovely piece and watching PHILIP GLASS playing this?
Saw him last Sunday in São Paulo, him and his other musicians were wonderful. Last time I saw him was in Houston Texas in 1974...phew
Dublin... beautiful sounds bringing calm & joy...
Every day glass is needed in my life
Feeling free

Mesmerising and goosebumpy 
Love your music 
Glorious!!
Violin Concerto #1 is my favorite piece of music hands down. Thanks for the brilliance that you share.

Best 20th century composer 
Beautiful.
I’m an ER MD sitting in an amazingly quiet ER and listening to this piece. I also play. I have always loved your music as far back to my college Percussion Ensemble.
Wonderful
Awesome !!!
Thank you for your music! Words can't express the beauty and heartfelt emotion that is felt with every note.
if glass had not existed, I would have had a huge hole in the soul.
How do you look back on your collaborations with Errol Morris and how did you compose differently for his films
For film scoring: Did you score to picture or did you give the filmmakers the score and they edited to your music?
Oh dear. It's so tedious!


Very tender music to my ears like  a walk on the beach. Water flowing
Moving and beautiful on such a profound level. It evokes feelings I don't want to name, lest they lose their ethereal quality.
Gracias
Philip Glass is the real deal.

Venha para o Brasil!!!!!
Soul soaring
Dommage que l'enregistrement soit aussi mauvais.
I imagine so much while listening to you play. Your playing allows me to think past stress and past daily pains. Past the notes, what images do you imagine whilst you play? Or what thoughts do you you have? Thank you.
Jon Ciambotti !!!
Lovely. His speaking shows his dedication and industriousness to his artistry as well as his humility and eagerness to listen and keep growing his art from hearing others perform
Fantástico.
Marvelous Phillip Glass

Beautiful.
Simply epic
I would like to ask him what felt during his writing of Pruitt Egoe
Imagine all this and more from The Taxi Driver. Great dedication. Thanks

Never stop!
Your music enables us to step out of the world to then embrace it.
Your music is what my circulatory system would sound like on the piano; heart, veins,  oxygen. Utterly human music. See you again in Big Sur next year.
This reminds me of a rain storm.
Beautiful!!!

"I like the culture of Nice because I like the Italians" Giuseppe Garibaldi felt exactly the same thing, as he was born in Nice. He never forgave Cavour, for gifting Nice to Napoleon III in exchange for Napoleon III's help in kicking the Austrians out of Italy.

I remember the beach sand. My feet were killing me but I drank a bottle of wine. I was only 17 at the time travelling Europe. My father was a tank commander during WWII and he drove the familly in his VW van to a point in town where his tank came upon a panzer. He survived.

Correction historique: Nice n'a jamais été italienne. Elle appartenait au royaume de Piémont-Sardaigne jusqu'en 1860, date où elle devient française. Ce n'est qu'en 1861 que l'Italie est unifiée et devient un pays.

We were there in June and loved Nice and surrounding Riviera.


Now I want one of those shirts... never been there, I just really like puns.
Beautiful city. Love the blend of the French and Italian cultures. Would return in a heartbeat. True about the beaches but seek out one of the resort beaches who have cultivated their beach area with the sandy beach we're accustomed to.

I could use some nice buzzes too. But they're not legal in Iowa.
Let's go back lol

The pebbles in Nice's  beaches are not natural and a choice in regard to erosion as well as hygiene. Every morning at about 5 am, a boat sprays water mixed with a mild disinfectant to clean. The pebbles allow for proper drainage.
We were there in 2012 and it really is beautiful.

Julien Rbr tkt je connais l'histoire de nice sur le bout des doigts  enfaite le le comté de nice faisait bien partit du royaume de Sardaigne mais le royaume de Sardaigne était un royaume a part entière ! l'Italie résulte du rassemblement des différents royaume qui etait sur le sol de l'actuelle Italie ! Et les niçois on eu à voté pour savoir si il voulait rejoindre le nouveau pays qui aller ce construire ( l'Italie ) ou la france ! La suite on la connais une victoire écrasante pour la france

Thank you for the portrait of my natal city, The New York Times. However... "150 years ago Nice was an Italian city" is grossly false: When the States of Savoy give Nice to France in 1860, Italy does not even exist (it was founded in 1861)... Nice was also not of "pre-Italian" culture, or spirit, at this time: The language spoken in the city was French, not Italian; actually, during the municipal plebiscite of 1860, 86% of voters opted for the attachment to France.
Par contre il y a qu'un quartier pour nighter ? Place du pin et rue Bonaparte ?

But its not true.  Nice belonged to Provence until it left to join Savoia which was partly in Piedmont and partly in France.  Italy was consolidated by these same people in 1862.  Nice was voted back to join France.  I dont even think there was a kingdom of piedmont except if it existed prior to the middle ages.
Très belle ville avec le Vieux Nice
I forgot that I was addressing myself to an Anglophone. Depending in which language and in which country you learnt European history, you would use different names to design the Kingdom of Sardinia. The official name was Kingdom of Sardinia (english), Regno di Sardegna (italian), Royaume de Sardaigne (french), Königreich Sardinien  (german). Innoficially, but commonly used in Europe are designations such as "Royaume de Piémont-Sardaigne" (french), "Kőnigreich Sardinien-Piemont" (german), Or "Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia" to emphasise that in the composite state under the rule of Savoy the Island of Sardinia was of secondary importance to the monarchy. The Turin Treaty of 24 March 1860 sanctioned the annexation of the Nice and Savoy counties to France, based on the secret agreement (1858) that if France would support the unification of Italy by Sardinia, in return Sardinia was asked to cede the Duchy of Savoy to France along with, more contentiously, the predominantly non french speaking County of Nice. In 1860 the state of Italy did not exist. Nizza (Nice) never belonged to Italy.

Oh that Earthquake was so terrible. May Allah protect us
Very sad situation but so wonderful to see all coming together to help, my thoughts to al!
Yvonne, please tell me you were not in Mexico City! I am so saddened!  xoxo! Sending you love!
Gracias por su comentario¡¡
We can do it, us Mexicans we fall together and we rise together #FuerzaMexico
Gracias¡¡
Excellent organized community effort! You all are in my thoughts and prayers
All I see are picks and shovels. Is there not one jackhammer in the whole of Mexico City?
This is Mexico! Our lovely Mexico <3
The display of unity and strength 
Vamos Mexico
Ask the government!!!!
A jackhammer will destabilize even further the debris. The vibrations alone could move lose debris on the people buried. As bad as it looks, the method they are using is the best approach for this kind of situations.
A very delicate operation, to rescue people under debris, they cannot use heavy machinery or tools.
Absolutely true!!
Thanks we need them.
are you for real?
example of valor, solidarity and compassion of Mexicans  I love Mexico 
Bravo. You are far better than the white eyes.
You are shiny, but you aren't that bright.
Hi, Rich. There are hundreds of those, of course, but the use of such tools is not recommended since they can actually hurt someone who might still be trapped under the debris. Bulldozers and heavy machines would help a lot, but remember there are still dozens of persons who might still be alive and the machinery would hurt them. So, as the man in the video said, they have to take all the bricks, debris and earth by hand, like little ants. That something we mexicans call "cadena humana", meaning "human chain", and that's a lot safer than jackhammers or bulldozers
I wish I could be there to help. Which organizations are collecting donations? My heart breaks for everyone in Mexico dealing with this disaster.
The Red Cross is colecting and receiving donatives. Also the Topos (Moles), a Mexican Civil Association for rescuers
Fuerza, México
‍
These ones, thank you.

May the hands of God be with those volunteers!
Did you ask that same question on 9/11 when people were buried underneath rumble and everyone was on high alert for any sounds of help?
UMCOR specify which disaster you want your money to go to.  100% of your donation goes to the disaster.  No admin costs, Church members pay those so donations can go directly to help.
This is Mexico! People with great heart! The residents didn't wait for the government to help. They rushed to help the people trapped.

Horrible tragedy, still very moving to watch all these people volunteer to help
Difficult times, but so proud of the strength and unity of the people. Local media said they are over 1 million volunteers  across MX city. #fuerzamexico

Tonight the federal police ordered LARGE HEAVY equipment into the site to scrape out all the wreckage--the thousands of rescuers are angry and trying to resist!

I don't see Trump sending help,racist president. Animos Mejico,el mundo esta contigo.
You can buy through the Home Depot website in Mexico, there's instructions on how to buy equipment and they'll send them directly where needed.
nice. seeing peoples care for each other in times of trouble.
Proud to be Mexican. And so proud of the unity of my people!!! 
I wish our country was helping, too.
We love you Mexicanos!!!!
Here is a list of different organizations, collection centers, or different ways in which you can help the rescuers and people directly affected by the earthquakes http://comoayudar.mx/index.html
The jewish ladies standing i think they r related to the  older guy missing i wonder if they  have found him :(
En espiritu con nuestro hermanos y hermanas Mejicanos
God bless México   con ustedes
Bless these people...so hard working, so loving.
Now more than ever, build that wall, Mr President!
#fakenews please don't post stuff without double checking first. It's dangerous.
This is Mexico  I'm proud Mexican!
Edwina, i did hear It's because there's possibility of people still alive trapped under the rubble. Rescuers want to help but if they start to "clean up" the wreckage it would kill whoever is still trapped in there...
https://www.gofundme.com/prayformexico-mexiconeedyou donate and share it please #prayformexico
https://www.gofundme.com/prayformexico-mexiconeedyou donate and share it please #prayformexico
Good work helping each other
God help them
Edwina Lantigua it is true.
Had they waited for the government, they would not have been helped. They STILL haven't helped, and have no plans to do so, either. :(
Tnx
What is your point exactly?
Tnx
Tnx
Edwin Pacheco Diegueto Ascencio
im assuming you live in Mexico ? ^
I totally agree with you, it is urgent that they lift that wall, never to have to see people as mean and miserable as you. You're pitiful, you're black skin and from experience you should know what it means to see you as a second citizen. Just ask God to never be in disgrace and someone treat you like leprous.
pruduces disgust and lastima, woman stupid. 
Robin Carrol you are such a disgraceful person. You are despicable and stupid, get a life.
Be careful! There's not topos account. Some people is asking for donations but they are taking the money for personal reasons.
When we come to rescue you we will make sure we come with a jackhammer. Somewhere in the vicinity of your brain if we can find it.

Absolutely uplifting to see the Mexicans so united.
Gracias por bendecir mi país, "tocaya" así decimos los mexicanos a los que se llaman igual. Gracias por sus muestras de afecto y sus palabras, estoy convencida que no todos allá nos califican de manera errónea. México también tiene gente valiosa igual que la tiene cada país!

A team of rescuers with dogs arrived today from USA and are working ! I saw them today near the fallen school.

You are deeply flawed and not a person who should ever receive any kindness. I can not believe Any God ever created you. You hateful creature.
I am so proud to be Mexican, to see all these people united to help thy fellow man. Rich or poor, everyone give their all to save a human life. You can see the men young and old work in the rubble while the women give food and water to everyone in need. They said that mexico is a poor country, yet rich in love for there fellow man. God Bless Mexico and there people. Mexico Strong
My version of prayer to you all
I feel so upset for all the Mexico people. I pray you find more people alive. Its so tragic. God Bless you all.
Fuerza Mexico!
So sad yet so humbling at the same time too see the fighting spirit and need to help each other. Our thoughts are with you all xx

HELP YOURSELF PLEASE WE ARE BUSY TO MORE DESTRUCTION AROUND THE WORLD - WE DON'T EVEN BOTHER YOU !!
Yes!!! It is a wonderful thing... Heartfelt Thought's to all of our fellow humanbeing's.. In this terrible tragedy..
Thank You all the World! it's hard, it's dangerous, and emotional,  We have a lot of problems in Oaxaca, Chiapas, Estado de México, Puebla, Morelos  need help for this to please.  Thank You for all! We know that Puerto Rico has problems with huracane Maria i'm sorry, We love You brothers !
Heartfelt empathy to All who are suffering from this tragic situation.. PLEASE ..know that NOT EVERYONE in U.S.A.  is Heartless and cruel...
God Bless these people and their stamina and resilience; I'm afraid that I would be so daunted and heartbroken in such circumstances I would be rendered helpless. :( 

Please don't just pray but give if you can:

Good work
build the wall around your house, that way you don't get close to any humans. You might be contagious    

There's only one race in the face of the earth "human race" and you don't belong.
Hay muchas personas amables en Mexico. Como asomboso.
Tools like us like jackhammer s and heavy machinery is not used until they are certain that their is no one underneath the debris, dead or alive, they want to rescue and recooparte as many bodies/people as possible. They use "topos" which are a  specialised group of rescuers, that have been used around the world, to find and extract people from underneath the debris. So YES, they do have jackhammers and heavy machinery but they know when and when not to use it.
This is the REAL México , people full of strength, heart, soul, solidarity, and unity. Proud to be Mexican proud to have been be on in such a beautiful nation..... #FuerzaMexico "UN SOLDADO EN CADA HIJO TE DIO"
PLSSSSSS DONT MAKE DONATIONS TO THE GOBERMENT..
No, it is not true. Please doublecheck facts like these before posting because it can turn violent. Please.
Just goes to show you when humanity works together things get done  too bad it's not kept up in good times 
Viva Mexico 
This is Mexico!!! We are united!! We helped each other!! And we will rise from this!! Remember this article, this photographs the next time your president tells you we are bad and he wants to  build the stupid wall, remember how we really are, mexicans with great hearts, brave and humble. #FuerzaMéxico 
Ainsley Nobara this is México.
This is Mexico, i so proud to be Mexican.
God bless mexico! Your unity & excellent community effort will make you all rise up again.

México is the best!!!
We pray for all the people in In the world going through everything we know God is comfort 
God bless people!!
Bless these folks who showed up to help anyone trapped by the earthquake!
Chrissy W. I guess the point you're trying to make is the Mexican's government is inept and corrupt but you're sitting on your high house if you live in the states. We are on our way to bring as corrupt and far more dangerous to fellow humans than Mexico could ever be. Not to mention that the citizens of the US get the luxury of paying for it.
Stupid, just stupid
Good hombres, good hombres!

De acuerdo absolutamente. No empañen las buenas obras  de la gente que no decaiga el animo de ayudar. Si no tienen nada amable que compartir no compartan.
Oh and I almost forgot to mention how well we did in Hurricane Katrina but I guess you must have forgotten that C. W.  Please tell me again how many weeks people waited to be rescued?
Thank you!

Gracias!
No necesitamos que estado unidos y gente racista apoye a nuestros hermanos en desgracia somos muchos los que cooperamos , el resto del mundo nos apoya , estado unidos no es el mundo gracias a dios somos un pueblo que se levanta a pesar de las desgracias 
No al gobierno nada!! Porque lo aprovecharán para sus campañas políticas aparentando solidaridad con la ayuda de otros pueblos o paises o de plano se lo repartirán entre tanto buitre!!!,,,,,  si alguien puede hacer algún comentario similar en algún otro idioma estaría perfecto para prevenir  de esto a otros países que quieran aportar ayuda,,,,gracias
Topos release a statement where they specifically said that they weren't asking for money. They don't have am account. They do what they do because that is their passion.
FUERZA MÉXICO 
Muchas gracias por la gente de Mexico. Our prayers are with you! This is beautiful how you are all working together.
Gracias
This is surely not looking like the rapists and thieves our stupid President is trying to sell us on. Looks like decent hardworking people coming together to help each other out. God bless you and keep you safe.
Dahlia Romero There's multiple Topos organizations. The one that said they're not taking donations is just one of them... the others don't actively ask for donations but Topos Tlatelolco does have an account if people want to donate. The money is for food and equipment... I mean it has to come from somewher, they need helments, vests, gloves, picks, harnesses, rope, flashlights, etc. Do you think it magically appears? Do you think they rescue people by praying? Stop spreading rumors that are discrediting these organizations and people that have saved many lives! They need the help! I at least know Topos Tlatelolco is real! This whole "do not donate" thing is just a battle of egos among them and considering the situation Mexico is in, I fiind it in very poor taste. smh
I wonder which brand they were working for? One of those expensive names, maybe making ted tides named trump? I wonder if the building was responsible inspected, knowing Mexico City is vulnerable for earthquakes.
But please know that the main city is
The courage and love shown in the face of tragedy makes me weep.
The power of humanity..... stay strong Mexico...
Very sad breaks your heart to know that people are trapped can't find your children
Parabéns ao povo mexicano pela solidariedade!!
GOD BLESS YOU ALL and help you recover from this  tragedy.
Hope everyone comes out safe!
I am so moved by the strength and love of the Mexican people. Stay strong. You will recover. You are a proud caring culture and I hope President Trump learns how wrong he is about his stupid wall!
Can u send through my PayPal please? Which is dontbestupid@gmail.com, thank u
super exemple de solidarité . Bravo aux mexicains ! Si rare ici.....
God bless you all.

You are doing a lot showing empathy. Thank you friend 
Que terrible
Deberías de aprender que en éstas situaciones no hay ideologías políticas ni religiosas. Miguel de la Madrid tuvo la puntada de no aceptar ayuda internacional en el 85 ¿y qué pasó? Murieron miles de personas que pudieron ser salvadas. Todos necesitamos de todos, bájale tres rayitas a tu orgullo y comprende que necesitamos toda la ayuda posible.
You are absolutely right!!! I have wonderful friends from USA; if some people are bad, it doesn't mean everybody is like that. <3
Bianca Scheiber  si eso hazlo saber a las autoridades mexicanas que están sacando a la gente que nos apoya como a los japoneses y al presidente trump que le negó la ayuda a México  o que no lees las noticias
Angeline Sky Guerrero Tú eres la que no lee las noticias y no sé qué tiene que ver tu xenofobia con todo esto. Los japoneses no fueron expulsados ni tratados mal, deja de leer chismes de revista, checa la página de la embajada japonesa, ellos se fueron ayer en la noche después de haber estado trabajando en Taxqueña. El gobierno de EUA mandó ayuda, rescatistas y bomberos que han estado partiéndose el lomo tratando de encontrar sobrevivientes. Eres una persona llena de bilis e ignorancia.

Wow tanto tiempo que me inviertes  
Trumpo:  "Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids, Rocket Man."
It will be great when Trump makes sure that we get one of these North Korean-style parades on our shores. Goose-stepping and everything. I can hardly wait...
cada ves que veo estos videos me da gracia "el marranito feliz" ,oinc oinc......
King is King, Fatty man is a modern King of North Korea and Donald Trump.
You know when you back someone into a corner and when they have nothing else to lose, they will fight aggressively.
So be aware....!!
Trump is playing a very dangerous game.
North Korea against several other countries? Who would win?
I have a serious question about north Korea current situation.  If north Korea truly owns the nuclear technology. Why didn't they use it in energy production. 
The infrastructure that belongs to thier reactors are an indication that this country no way has a nuclear weapon let alone a hydrogen bomb. 
I think China is the one playing behind the scenes. North Korea doesn't have what it takes to manufacture all of this
i 'd ride  you like a  horse that would 've  been taught you what a man can do
Specially they are seeing Iran, Iran gave up all it's nuclear power with hope of ending US hostility, but no luck, US need enemy to survive.
Leave North Korea alone, all I see is war propaganda. They are a sovereign nation and have all the right to defend themselves.
Russia russia
With help from china and Russia
The United States provided part of it around a decade ago
Gesture means everything.  Goose stepping says it all.
They now will have to take a second look at with having trade link with NK. Pres. Trump has ordered the treasury and all gov\'entities concern to punish those who would go against his boycott...
And yet....how many Americans can even show you where North Korea is on a map ????

What the hell are you talking about ???
Gary Ayres: My comment is meant to be sarcastic (in case you were wondering).
Has anyone ever considered all along all Jong-un wants is to be treated like an equal? His only bargaining chip is his presumed military prowess. So, in a family, how is the youngest made to feel they are as good as their older siblings?

Humphrey Lumphrey Trumphrey sat on a wall, 
Humphrey Lumphrey Trumphrey made a big call,
All his resources and all his recourses couldn't put North Korea together again.
Let's get it over with!!!!!   Enough is enough!!!!
That's worse cgi than a spider man movie.
That is exactly what he wants. And nothing will change that or his nuclear program. Dangling carrots instead of war has always been a better diplomatic move.
Boycotts have never been effective. There's always ways around them.
Supposition on peyote and/or steroids.......  In other words, lies and propaganda.......
They're coming... .
China and Russia obviously prompts N. Korea.

We are just stupid to remember in the Korean war after N. invaded the S., 10,000 US troops under Gen. McArthur were about to knock out the N. Korean regime until none other than China, sent 450,000 troops to N. Korean aid.

N. Korea is controlled by a mad man. A Chinese-Russian backed mad man.

If there is no God to protect us, you can be sure WW3 will be the extermination of mankind.

They buy from Iran and china. Is this hard? Ohhh yeah and we gave Iran money so they could buy equipment to sell to NK ... GJ everyone.
Hahaha nice try North Korea . You guys suck. Your little scheme here is very transparent. I could see you two dicklesss wonders coming a mile away
You didn't give them money.  You released their money that you had been holding since Iran hostage situation.  The money was theirs.
You mean this lunatic outsmarted, pulled one over on, the geniuses at UN? What a surprise. Btw, where is UN in Syria? Aren't they supposed to set up and maintain adequate refugee camps? Ridiculous. F the UN.
The UN is not a friend to the United States.  #AMEXIT
Except when they bomb, bomb, you back.
Marie Feijo .... cool so we released their money to build weapons to give to our enemies to blow us up. Do you feel better?

Good Luck!

Pretty soon this is what Trump's military will looks like in his suggested parade
Guerra !guerra !guerra!
Trump is like a child getting mad just about everything; off course the other countries would trade with the north when US isnt considered an ally anymore 
Kori Alexander  lol. It's ok to question everything this government does. We have a track record of disastrous foreign policy, namely Iraq, Libya, Yemen so on. We been bombing brown people for last 40 years or so.
Kim Jong Un said on Friday the North will consider the "highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history" against the United States in response to Trump's threat to destroy the North. Calling Trump "mentally deranged" and his comments "the most ferocious declaration of a war in history," Kim said his U.N. speech on Tuesday confirmed Pyongyang's nuclear programme has been "the correct path". "I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U.S. dotard with fire," Kim said in the rare direct statement, referring to Trump.
Bitcoin.
Very eye-opening & informative!  North Korea has much more access to weapons,  (only God knows if any nuclear) than we may have been aware of... scary that we have Trump & Kim Jong -Un  are pulling the strings of the puppets.
Holy crap!!! Hell...
Okay, so this is how "Rocket Man" plays games.

Please get these two mentally deranged heads treated.
One thing you can count on is, if the US ends up in another war, sons of dtrumpf won't be going to war. I'm pretty sure bone spurs are genetically inherited...you know; like cowardice.
If there wasn't any nukes my money is on N.Korea,they would crush the US as there military been training for years and half the US soldiers are on drugs or drunk.lol
The U.N. is a dog raised by the U.S.
Why can USA have the Nukes and North Korea not?

Good luck with tracking sanctioned items going thru China.  I’ve often wondered if North Korea isn’t China’s secret weapon.
Sanctions is a capitalist idea. Means nothing to N Korea.
It is - and Russia's too.  Kim is the mouth piece of China and Russia to humiliate Trump and US.
North Korean has high IQ ... 
Ed Khan --- I was rather hoping someone would provide information that would reveal my suspicion wasn’t true, but you validated it.  
What are your observations revealing about the following possibility?
How the dots seem to connect in a straighter line is that Putin WANTS the US public to believe he is anti-trump --- for trump’s sake and the next election, BUT in reality Putin and trump are bosom-buddies (thrump’s wife and Putin’s girlfriend are close friends).  Good grief --- in Syria, trump didn’t bomb the military air strip run-way.  It was all show.
Defending a state responsible for starving, murdering and enslaving it's own people in pursuit of nuclear weapons. Interesting...
US is pressurising NK to start a war.
David Hathaway You be a dotard too
Trump is playing his trump card on this pathetic phucktard
Funny thing is many probably agree with you but didn't notice the sarcasm...
Eric Littlepage: I think so. To be fair, I didn't make it clear enough that I was being sarcastic, and in this day and age its hard to tell. There probably are more than a few people out there that would like to see American service members goosestepping in a ticker tape parade down the streets of Manhattan.
This is also one of the hypocritical act which has been done in earlier time. They all are making fun of innocent people. Politics Rocks !!!
I think they march funny!!

Americans and their lying grapichs. We Will never forget your grapich about Irakien "nuclear trucks". USA the war loving country.
Unless Korea has China and Russia backing them they have no foot to stand on.  Follow the money
China, Russia, and North Korea are communist.  Do you actually think they don't back each other
He is a smart. He is a young but he is older then D J Tr as a president.
He is right to have much nucleus for his country. He has big enemies. He needs to be strong. I stand with you.

Oh look!! a parade just like the one Trump wants!
Judson Parker so said the socialist. You can't even be taken seriously.
That crazy fat kid cant even sneeze without China's permission. So no he's not gonna starts anything and he knows it but he's gotta throw some jabs at Trump.
hopefully they will drain all their  energy doing that silly walk- it looks exhausting
Sanctions makes u stronger inside. Its help u to develop urself. Example cuba. After 40 years of sanctions cuba is still on its feet and largely.
Matthew Carlson can't the same be said of US, Saudi and so many others?
Let's see US imposed sanctions on Iraq that killed about 500,000 children, not a crime?
US destroyed Iraq, Libya , Afghanistan and so many other countries murdering thousand in the process.
Saudi... Well you get my point
WE LOVE NORTH KOREA AND WE LOVE ROCKET MAN - SORRY TRUMP YOU WILL NOT EXIST ANYMORE ANYWHERE VERY SOON !!
It's not just the DPRK that's accomplishing this on their own. PRC must also be in on it
Agreed!
Please!  This is much too boring!  Let's get to the mushroom cloud!  Ratings!!!!  Benghazi!!!!!
Nicole Ono
conspiracy
David Hathaway sarcasm rarely works in a written media
If there is a war
I'm with the Korean army
And I'm Pakistan,
All N. Korea is doing is ensuring that the US won't destroy it as it did Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria etc...etc....etc....
Calviri
US double standard and hypocrisy.
USA are u stupod? The world needs N. Korea toske money---wake up.
Soon it will be time to bring in the already finished genius solution. A world government. "Hegelian dialectics".
Christopher Britton and that got a good laugh from Macron in case you did not notice! The great baboon is the laughing stock of the world.
Just like Trump's plan for a border wall with Mexico or the ongoing failed war on drugs. Banning something doesn't fix the problem. #ThatLibertarian
Kill Kim!!!
Leave Rocket Man alone !
Yes! It's like it  China and Russia maintaining a cold war. 
 Mr TRUMP to power, soon dolphins loaded with explosives.
From France it's amazing
Why should US attack North Korea with nucs when they can easily drop some iphones  with free WiFi and I'm  sure that the North Koreans with rebel against Kim Jong.
We released THEIR money that they gave us to purchase weapons that we never delivered. In exchange, we got them to scrap their nuclear weapons program and submit to the most vigorous monitoring program in world history to prove it.
Building a reactor that can operate safely is way more expensive and way more difficult than building a missile.
Also, China definitely shared missile guidance technology and weapons launch systems with NK. We can literally see Chinese missile trucks during NK military parades
Russia isn't communist
We could destroy NK without even breaking a sweat. It would be like a grown man fighting a little girl. The problem is that they would shell Seoul, a city of 25 million people whose protection we have guaranteed since armistice. NK was able to develop these weapons without our interference by holding Seoul hostage

he wont pay the consequences but someone elses children will of all action of a draft dodger HIS UGLINESS PERVERT IN CHIEF trump . sick
Mike Razak, sorry I missed the part where Iran threatened US. But then again no threats from Cuba and Venezuela either yet he went after them too.  Says every leader should put his country first with no interference and then sticks his nose in it.  Btw, you're selling arms to Saudis what will they do with them?
DPRK's smuggling expertise and its intelligence service are so underestimated
President Trump has once again made the right choice by preventing NK from making more money for their nukes. Obama would have knelt before Rocket Man.
Erika Medina this might answer your question
That's interesting. You're probably right.
Also, in NK the welfare of people is meaningless. Draconian socialist tactics keep them in line and lack of welfare concern keeps the population in check. Affordable nuclear power is a low priority as it would benefit the people more than the government.
Never, never in America. Trump is the opposite of a socialist. He supports  our military. Our army does not promote the ideology associated with goosestep marching. Our troops are trained to think, respond, report, communicate. Look at photos of American troops - You can see their individuality. As long as we maintain land of the free, home of the brave our soldiers won't go for it. Too many have fought and died to suppress the spread of those ideologies.
Well that's an interesting thought
Phil Modelle yes, absolutely.
Well, even as well fed and fortified as Germany was in WWI and WWII, several other countries still took care of it in a few years. 
NK, starved and antiquated, shouldn't take years. We just  have to try and avoid killing a lot of non-combatants and blowing up Seoul.
Never, never in America under Pres Trump. Trump is the opposite of a socialist. He supports  our military. Our army does not promote the ideology associated with goosestep marching.

I think Jeff Bezos should  help us out here. If we break trade with China, Amazon goes out of business. He has probably already got China on board to police their ports and shipping.
Jill McMahon
Sandra Soria parades are American. Goosestepping is not.
Sorry, I thought you were being serious about the goosestepping. Too early in the morning for me to spot humor. Nothing wrong with a good parade. I don't know how long since we've had a really big parade but there are  'little' ones all the time. I've signed a lot of orders sending troops, arms, equipment and vehicles to parades and static displays. Lots of community requests. Entire branch at the Pentagon for just such community support.

Gary Ayres trump made this comment. He said he enjoyed Bastille Day and maybe the US could have a similar parade on 7/4 down Pa Ave.  Dictators do like their parades.

I knew someone would undoutebdly rebuttal with your comment David. The US gives over 1 billion dollars in aid and most definitely can feed it's own people comparatively speaking to the PRK. KSA is not threatening the annihilation of any country or group of people and maintain a stable yet authoritarian government style but atleast they secure they're borders.  Your 500,000 killed children by Iraq is not backed up by any credible independent organization and although civilian deaths being unfortunate in any war are still going to happen when fighting an enemy (ISIS) that literally hides behind children.  Get your facts straight and understand foreign policy before polluting the internet.
Not a fan of Trump, but the US and the world dropped the ball on this decades ago...
What I did notice is that  some information you referenced that some of the information was provided by United States (U.S.) Intelligence apparatuses. It is widely known that the donald's Regime does not trust the U. S. intelligence agencies, and in fact is at odds with it. If the leader of a country is saying that its agencies can't be trusted, should the rest of the world trust those same agencies. Which leads to this conclusion The leader of the Trump regime is "Deranged". All of the evidence of fact points to that statement being true.@Florida Shark Publishing

REGIME     CHANGE   IS  THE  ALTERNATIVE
Of course China and Russia make the NK powerful and still will be done. Sanction/isolation to NK isnt and wouldnt work. Not options available.
Lisa Haskins 
Trump has no understanding of what democracy even means
He can barely complete a sentence let alone relate coherent thought.
Wanting to promote a military parade is dictator mentality such as is fascist ideology
I know what our military is now
Where do you think it will end up under Trump!
Sad!!!!!
Big pipelines from Russia and total support from Jiang zemins criminal Chinese groups allow this.
Should the Trump Regime punish Venezuela also, if they do not commit to his authoritarian rule. He has threaten the sovereignty of that nation also. I would not like that any other nation should threaten the sovereignty of OUR United States of America. That is why I detest The traitors which once did (ca. 1860)
Evil always finds a way. Would it not be more productive to somehow, someway defy normal convention and open a dialogue?
The East (tradition) will always take care of their own, no matter what country it is.....so outside countries trying to stop eastern countries from trading or dealing with each other is such major BS.
Bob Cherin Sarcasm only works for the literate. It's been used in written works (including the Bible) for centuries.
Use our superior all voluntary and destroy North Korea for the sake of South Korea, Japan, Guam ,and all the Southeast Asia region. Get it over with , before Kim carries through on his talk, we need to be proactive not reactive.
Leila Dowlatshahi it’s you who can’t be taken seriously. Congress just approved a $700 billion “defense” budget which will be used to fatten the wallets of private military contractors. Private contractors push for war and global police actions because it boosts their sales. These are undeniable facts.
Doing it on military bases like we have been doing for decades is one thing. Marching through the streets like in square is something completely different.
Derek Johnston
Sending missiles over Japan (Although be it way above their air space), is not really considered "defending themselves".
Kelsey Magen
h o l y s h i t

What about those fancy planes, trains and bombs the US shows off when bombing women, kids and defenceless Arab armies with just rifles? They're all sh**t scared of NK and the Rocket Man. Cowards
Charlotte Vetter
Matthew Carlson,
The facts tell a very different story from your... Facts.
The US gives billions in aid usually in weapons, weapons that will cause more deaths.
Do tell who are some of the biggest recipients.
The US engaged directly and indirectly in the overthrow of countless governments. Well all south America was a victim.
The ability or lack of NK to feed it's people is not a reason to attack it.
What do you think will happen if you attack?? 
Less food of course , more famine.
The US sanctions did kill thousands in Iraq , Madeline Albright famously said the price was worth, talking about morality.
You gallantly say civilian deaths in war happen.
Of course you forgot to mention it was US who started the wars .unjustified wars, wars of aggression.
Don't come with the collateral damage , it is mass murder.
US wasn't fighting ISIS when it invaded Iraq , Afghanistan, and bombed Libya , was it?
ISIS is another product of US wars.
Get your facts straight
Lastly do you know the US tested its nukes in the Pacific islands and it radiated island populations on purpose to study the effects of radiation?
A fact
Anything that disturb US will surely make huge imbalances,life threat ,global impact to world that will result hell to the world.We should always support US but not on war without valid reason
Shoot that's it, you know there has to be more..this should be at least a half hour of how North Korea skirts UN sanctions.
He should just crawl into one of those little black boxes that are designed to kill rats known as "Camp Davids"  furthermore there's an old saying back home.... Geezers
So, if we know this, is it all pointless banter at the UN?
Talitha Iamamoto
Bravo Kim Jong montre à l'Amérique que vous êtes le plus fort. J'en ai marre de voir la France à la botte des américains. Ils complotent entre eux pour créer un nouvel ordre mondial pour faire de nous des esclaves.
Woah
Be careful! Be careful! Don't sink American prosperity? Don't go for a unnecessary nasty war, Trump should not play with this guy he has nothing to loose so he will fight hard to destroy American empire.
You rock uncle kim 

TIME FOR TOTAL BLOCKADE <> We still have not done ALL of what we can do.
Dont buy chinese Products. China supports this fat man and Trump is right
/s

David you dropped this.

What is the UN doing to cripple Americas vastly more dangerous nuclear program?
Niklas
Tom Voltaire Okwalinga better check the last part of this video  kagu's comment on North Korean isn't seating well
The problem is that there are not enough resources to police this.
Russia. Russia is how skirt sanctions
Because the government already controls the wifi

Sadly UN is weak due low support and minimal contributions. I wish a real united UN had more power to confront and stop this (and many other) escalating conflicts.
Nick Van Der Steenhoven
Kim and trump ..... let the world for honored rulers take care, stop hunger in the world. and health, but education, equal rights for all ,, Brazil receives here and paradise, we also have defects, social .roubo corruption, but still here and paradise
Kbir Aissat
we are sick and tired of the media all the media Liars.....
Matthew Carlson: So what did you do when Stalin did the same? And when Gen Franco did the same? Where were your principles? Did you yell, revolt or interfere with your ‘long’ nose and threaten him? We all know the answer... so, why didn’t you do anything then? Why now?
Haaris Alvi
Iran just test fired an ICBM that can reach Isreal ... are we still having a productive conversation?
Yet trumps family keeps making personal deals with china.  And no one cares.

Tara, what do you do to take care of your voice when you're not singing? How long does it take you to warm up?

There are two musicians here. Why is the pianist not credited?
Hello! What is more important on the big scenes - technological or artistic skills?
How difficult is it to sing in a room and not on the stage?
Bravo!
Not a question, but please tell her that her ornaments are so unique and perfect!

Simply wonderful. All three, magnificent in their own ways!
Is she nervous?
Technique is not complete or solid in the first two singers. Plus no emotional connection. I can’t believe these are met debuts these are students who need to understand why they’re singing and sing better. I’m skipping the third
Stunning, Angel Blue.
Thank goodness for art and beauty in these times
She is wonderful
You good one from Los Angeles
Do you feel more comfortable singing Puccini then Other composers?
Angel Blue is a MAJOR opera talent......looking forward eagerly to hearing her in the Met's La Boheme.
:-)
Beautiful singing with clear rapid fire coloratura....BRAVA!
I think it's too fast!

This Mezzo is fantastic! Would love to hear her and Pretty Yende do the Semiramide duet.
Wow incredible performance Angel and all 3 ladies 
@Maria Lima She is a Mezzo Soprano, not a Soprano!!
@Yinka: She is a Mezzo, not a Soprano
@Karyme: She is a mezzo
@Megan it is italian by Rossini La Cenerentola
@Jordan, Each voice type has to choose from the repertoire written for them
@Myan, good singing is not only having a talent, it is hard work, most of all on the body and the breath, voice and style and interpretation to follow. It does not fall from heaven according to the wish to sing. Learning to sing means working on the personality also!
@Tina more than you could ever imagine and it depends on many, many factors to consider, it is not only a wish or a decision, it is a life long lasting process and means also a lot of energy and patience combined with a strong mind and the ability not to give up
@Spencer to achieve this easyness is the most difficult in singing as there have a lot of things to be comboned together, it is not only of having a musicianship or having a nice voice
@Jester ??? Foster Jenkings was a Joke, singing totally wrong and out of tune, what do you mean with yr comment???
@Susan No, she is not, she is controlled and focussed as a professional singer should always be
Shane Carlton Tucker Have you heard of Angel Blue
Just beautiful.

Golda really brought out that particular  aria and defined it. There is always so much going on in the Magic Flute that this aria often gets glossed over. Golda has brought that aria out to the front for me. Beautiful choice. You own that aria.

This is so awesome, Golda! Glad the old hometown got a mention in the comments. :-) I cried in your piece because it was performed so beautifully. You have come so far since school and we're all so very proud of you. "So what happens now?"
I'm in love!
Proudly South African
Angel Blue <3 WOW, gorgeous!
Brava Angel Blue!!! So Beautiful!
Bravi Tutti!
YES Golda, SING! <3
Always gorgeous!
Fantastic!
Absolutely Beautiful  Angel !!!

outstanding melismas
Great to hear this wonderful irish singer. On an Ipad in S carolina
Lovely voices
You ladies are lovely. Toi toi toi!
Exquisite!
Beautiful angel ! Will be there for your Mimi love hugs anita
An exquisite singer whose use of speaking voice could cause a threat to her career. I think she needs to be careful, and possibly do some work with a speech therapist.
Love you Angel! So proud of you! You go girl!
Very nice cadence and articulation!

She is wonderful.
Goosebumps
Beautiful
Brava Tara
Rhodes University, in the Eastern Cape. (Or rather - the University Currently Known as Rhodes, UCKAR, as it battles to shake off its colonial past). 

I'm not sure UCT would ever be described as a liberal arts college... (but even if I'm wrong about that, Golda was also a distinguished university debater at Rhodes)
Go Tara!

Nia Drummond
Beautiful!!!
This is amazing! Golda
Yessssss!!!!!
Gorgeous, lavish voice! So free and spinning tone! LOVE HER VOICE!
Gloriously sensitive coloratura! A free and exciting tone! Legato is seamless! Brava!
Irish Mezzo:  A true artist painting lovely phrases. Excellent acting expression and intelligent, thoughtful meaning flashes across her face! I LOVE IT! Totally mesmerized.
The role of Cenerentola is for a mezzo. Folks who think she is a soprano, do not realize that a lyric soprano will not have the low notes of this aria. There is such a thing as a "Mezzo-Coloratura."
Gorgeous singing Angel!
Love this video. What a luscious treat!
Heavenly
Yo les preguntaria .cuando por espana?
Las tres geniales .Golda S. para mi  .me impresiona mas .me encantaria verlas por españa sera un privilegio

YESSSS

Wow! A Pamina for the ages! Lovely!
Does she sing any other Mozart roles? Fiordiligi, for example?
Can we get a shoutout for the pianist, the great Dan Saunders???
Exquisite tone! Absolutely gorgeous sound 
Amazing control 
Uau!
Chills listening to you Tara, always a superstar, even as a kid xxxx
Excelente....
mezzo
I heard all 3 ladies in their debuts and they nailed their performances! Kudos (Y)
She sang Vitellia in "La Clemenza di Tito" at the Salzburg Festival this summer Richard!
I heard Golda in the season premiere of "Die Zauberflöte" and she was wonderful (Y) <3
I am so impressed. The singer is also wonderful

Mmmmm loveliness.
Bella.
They desperately need a italian coach... The exact same flaw most american singers have is that they can't pronounce proper italian. Just listen Joyce DiDonato's  "Laisha ch'Iou piaingaou".
Marcella Brown
Awesome
Wow! This version was absolutely beautiful. Thank you for sharing this with me Dr. Darnell 
Beautiful! Brava!
Che meraviglia
Wow #2 was crazy
Beautiful woman,great beautiful voice!!!

Superb!
Amazing voices!  Talented women!
She is definitely ready to come out into the world at her debut. Don't hide this voice.
Saw Angel Blue in the dress rehearsal for La Boheme yesterday. She sang beautifully.  Wishing her all the best in her debut on Sunday! She is an amazing Mimi!
Belle
Ohhhh how beautiful
She's not a young Marylin Horne!
Heard Tara as Cenerentola in Vienna...fine singer
Brava!
Bravo
Beautiful, dramatic, powerful voice. Exciting

Great job!
Lovely rendering of " Ach, Ich fuhls"!!

Climate change on full display.

Oh, those poor people.
So a century ago there was global warming too? 
Bibiana Sampaio
Gene Gomes so why 2 hurricanes category 5 in less than 2 weeks in the same place? Soo what is the "fuel" of a hurricane? Hot water or cool water? You talk about global warming and Pham talks about a climate change and there are well documented changes. The nature doesn't care if you believe or not.
maybe Clinton Foundation can help Haiti again....
My family is in Puerto Rico. I haven't been able to contact them in two days, but I'm sure they are ok. The things I can't change I must accept, I just hope they restore the essential services in a timely manner.

Paige Haywood quite different from when we were there!!!

Good afternoon. I present myself in this way to make a small request for help to those who can and want to collaborate with a little money for a very expensive operation that for reasons of the economic situation of my country Venezuela, I can not afford it myself. I would be enormously grateful that I can birndar your collaboration with whatever. Those who want to help me can write to me by private message. Thank you very much in advance

Antonio Feula 
Oh nooooooo
Louci Wylie thank you so much! I've tried everything, but they live in a remote area and there is no way to get there right now. I have heard that their area wasn't affected that much, so I have faith that they are ok. Thank you so much, blessings!
Megan Arroyo 
Municipalities are devastated, bridges connecting cities have collapsed leaving them isolated. Municipalities like Cataño are under water. No communication... help is needed...
The wealthy people of America are going to have to pay higher taxes, we low income people can not afford to pay more in taxes to rebuild our country,  where is the Chaney Foundation ??????
can't find the NYT Harvey-Climate-change-lecture-from-frack-paper article but here is my response which NYT declined to publish: In New York Times's recent article relating major storms like Harvey to climate change world-wide, one set of dots has not been connected.  Media across the country, including the New York Times, has often promoted shale gas hydrofracking, the conversion from coal to fracked gas for heat and electricity, and by implication, the infrastructure involved to make that switch.  

Petroleum engineers and climate scientists like Dr Tony Ingraffea and Dr Robert Howarth of Cornell have looked closely at methane leakage from wellhead to delivery in shale gas operations and found that it may hemorrhage at rates from 5% to 12%.  It turns out that only for leakage rates of a very few percent can shale gas be considered even as clean as coal.  

The deal with methane is this: it heats the atmosphere 80-100 times more efficiently than CO2 in the 20 years we have left to save the planet. This is accepted in the science community, and by the UN.  

Waste water injection causes severe earthquakes: Even Oklahomans have had to admit this.  As per the EPA's revised report, fracking causes widespread water contamination.  Compressors for pipelines emit carcinogenic volatile organic compounds like formaldehyde and benzene. Methane is cooking the planet and superstorms put coastal cities like NYC at risk.

It could be you are far enough away from the mayhem caused by shale gas infrastructure to ignore it.  But we live in a state that banned fracking because all the science says it is dangerous, and yet we import more fracked gas each year than the year before, and we need to keep adding pipelines to move this gas.  Pipelines leak and explode and despite industry hype, evidence points to pipelines hurriedly installed in the last decade failing at higher rates than those put in the ground 75 years ago.  I appreciate that you’ll have to think hard about publishing this piece. I can only quote Upton Sinclair in response: “It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.”  Shale gas is the dirtiest fuel on the planet.  Your inability to wrap your head around that has nothing to do with science.

Dear Angel R Cruz Walker how are you doing?? What a terrible situation! I hope you and your loved ones are in safety 
With all of the problems in Puerto Rico I wonder how many people will move state's side? Labor shortages in many places could prompt a large exodus.
Why has Trump only given Puerto Rico disaster status? Why not emergency status?
I've been thinking the same thing. I think it's prudent, even if only as a means to finance the recovery at home, or to be productive while things stabilize in PR.
But it's Puerto Rico, not Haiti, that suffered from Maria.
Effects of a damaged planet?
A friend of mine has family in PR, and she's been able to post in some online forums from some on the islands.
Louci Wylie I think is depends on where you are located. I can't wait to talk to my parents and sister!
Elena Hubner
The damage are done to Our beautiful earth !! For people dumb like Trump Idiot. That's it
So sad :(
Filipa Pires san juan
I was born and raised in Puerto Rico. Based on my experience, hurricanes are getting bigger and stronger because the waters are hotter than before. I was there in 1998 for hurricane George, but María was by far a bigger monster!
Kari Klein
What the hell does that have to do with this article, you wast of oxygen?
How do you know he hasnt? The government doesnt have to tell YOU everything. Stop making this about politics. We get it, you hate Trump, but not everything is about him, you human turnip.
Fuuuck this just break my 
Do you know anything about gurabo?
Unfortunately, communication is literally none. Few things are being recorded from helicopters. Puerto Rico is basically under water
This is how the municipality of Toa Baja ended https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1985434298395123&id=1673036206301602

The amount of dead is still unknown due to lack of communication and access

I hope they received the help, like in México. The unity of the people is the best tool in this kind of situation and I'm sure then when we heal our people we will send people there.  all prayers to Puerto Rico

Olga, my friend is using an app called Zello. I think her parents are in the NE corner of the island. She just found out that the neighborhood they live on was destroyed, but everyone is safe.
Good luck!

Raymond Melendez if you decide to go to P.R to help let me know. I'll come do the same!
I can’t imagine 3 week’s without power, let alone 4-6 months without power. The island is definitely going to need our assistance and prayers. #prayfor
Gregg Barnes if you were in the disaster area, you'd have a different attitude....and, btw, the childish name-calling is just a negative reflection on your character.

Nothing to offer hahaha. That is a good one. One of the world's best collections of European art, amazing nightlife and very vibrant atmosphere. Not to mention food. I'm glad it is not the typical easy average city that everyone would like. That makes it even more special.

Personally I do not care for Barcelona.  We were there last Christmas and while waiting for a table a couple from Spain asked how we were enjoying our trip.  I felt the best part was the market...I loved looking at all the different foods and the people lined up waiting to get a sit - but Madrid was more colorful to me, preferred the museums there..the tapas, etc. and visiting other towns by rail I found more accessible.  It's like day and night...the guy agreed and said yes you like the real Spain.

Still have to visit Madrid someday, but Lisbon seems better. For one thing, it's on the water, not inland.

Good point. Don't understand C separatism at all, except as self-oriented materialism like in northern Italy (could be wrong about that), but trying to squelch it completely by force looks like it will backfire.

Been in Madrid 20 years now. There isn't enough money in the world that would get me to leave this country, particularly this city, to go back to the states. Love the people, the food, the culture, and a long etc.

I lived there for two years an an Auxiliar teaching English; it was fun but I had enough. I don’t see myself going back to Madrid to live; I’m happy back home in California.

Nicholas Babisch I love many things about Spain - the bull business is an atrocity, though, and not cute or adorable (Peter Maz). I also am not comparing many despicable things the US does and there are many of them.
Elena Giribaldi
Haekeum Kim
Francesca
mooi filmpie
There are parts of Spain where bullfighting is forbidden (Catalonia and Canary Islands), and there are many people who are fighting to forbid it in the whole nation, in fact it's the majority of people... but it's hard because it moves a lot of money and it's seen by some ignorant people as a tradition to keep...
Lizzy Wagner
Yale Chadsey I understand, there's only 2 soccer stadiums there and all
Jesper Hammerstrøm bare drik videre
Byron Jiménez Sedeño Thank you for clarifying this issue for me. I wish there would be a national ban on this cruelty and I applaud the people who are fighting to forbid it. I can just imagine the difficulty in removing this ugly tradition and the moneyed interests behind it.
I like Spain - just not the tradition of running of the bulls and bullfighting. Cruel and sickening.

Spanish food and wine is cheaper?! And.. The quality? You pay for it..
Even if that is true.. Sorry but we will not compare the food between Portugal and Spain..
Almost people don't know the diversity of Portuguese gastronomy.. Come to Portugal and see yourself..
And wine? XD
The only wine I hear from Spain is Alvarinho and we even have it too..
Porto wine.. Moscatel wine.. And red wine from Alentejo and Douro..

Responsible for the massacre: Myanmar's so-called Nobel leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Thousands of women, children, elderly civilians are being massacred. Some are burned, some are tortured and killed. I'm crying but nothing comes from my hand. It is very important that you valuable and strong non-governmental organizations take the world's attention to this massacre. Respectfully from Turkey.

*Isn't sober for one minute of it*
You get a much nicer view from El Corte Ingles Gourmet Experience in Callao. But the Circulo de Bellas Artes terrace is a good choice after a play.
Believe me! I live in Madrid and the majority of people are against bull fighting. The new major has cut all funding for the Bull Fighting school and shows. Unfortunately, there's a lot of political interest within the ruling party in this subject.
Joe Strathern
Nicole Skeeters
Miss it! Let's go back!
this hurts and it made me dizzy
Miguel Ângelo You do know there are other wines in Spain aside from Albariño, right? For example, Verdejo is an exquisite white wine from the central region of Spain. If you are judging food by it's price, I'm afraid to tell you it's way cheaper to eat in Portugal than to eat here in Spain (especially Madrid). It would never cross my mind that Portuguese food's quality is inferior just because it's cheaper.

You're right! People who are looking for night life and beach prefer Barcelona but Madrid has endless cultural possibilities, the arquitecture is amazing and every district has a character of its own. I've been living here for almost 4 years now and I never cease to discover new things in its streets.

It´s nice from NYT making a video of lovely Madrid even if many important things are missing, but I should note that first of all the Plaza Mayor should be shown in a better perspective than showing some flamenco suits. You can´t see the gorgeous plaza and flamenco is an Andalousian thing. Then again it's Latina Quarter, not Latin, and if you go any day other than sunday, you won´t be able to visit the Rastro.
It's an intolerable cruelty.
Two beautiful ladies!!! You two should model  miss you!!!
Amen

Soo sad !!
My heart is breaking for these families.

Just horrific

Profoundly sad.
Heartbreaking. :(

Poor babies. 
Estamos contigo Mexico!!!

So terrible 
To all of my friends outside Mexico . If you love tacos  , burritos  , mariachi  , tequila , piñatas  , nachos  , mezcal , margaritas, horchata, dulce de leche, quesadillas, churros, Frida Khalo , Cancun and Puerto Vallarta  etc. now is the time to show your appreciation. The heart of our country experienced the most devastating earthquake of our decade (7.1) . Hundreds are dead and who knows how many people are still under the debris since a bunch of buildings full of people collapsed within seconds. Donating to Topos Mexico through PayPal is the one thing we can do from the outside to help. They are the non-profit organization most qualified to respond in this kind of emergency

This is heartbreaking!  #PrayersForMexico
There is 6 kids alive waiting to be rescued, this is not over :)

Truly devastating, my heart hurts for the children, and their families. What a horrific, traumatic experience no one should ever have to go through.

So sorry!

So sad
so sad :(

I doubt we'll even send anyone to Puerto Rico with Trump, and I wish I was being sarcastic.
So sad.
My country is in deep pain, but we will rise again #staystrongmexico

Its a catastrophe 
Mi corazón partido

Heartbreaking.....they are still working to rescue at least one little that is still trapped but alive, hope they can take her out soon

Heartbreaking.
So sorry.
No comment (so sad)
This is terrible...my heart goes to all the victims...hope u find strength amidst all tge calamities and disasters...please stay strong 
We are waiting for 6 kids in a few minutes
If it is not war it is natural disaster! What's this horrible life:'(
Rio read the first comment  it's all about the school
Remember 2 earthwakes in two weeks, september 7th in Chiapas and Oaxaca (8.2) and september 19th in CDMX, Morelos and Puebla (7.1) we need your help
so tragic... prayers to all the families
I am mearly pointing out that this was obviously not a very safe building for a school in an earthquake prone area so dont get mad at me, get mad at the people who decided it was ok for an elementary school
sad moments for maxico.!!!

30 is a lot  Condolences to the victim family 
Why would any one respond with a heart or a laughing face.  That is pretty sick, this story is about dead kids.
My heart is broken today. So much loss in the world....
Heart breaking

We must pray for Mexico City & San Juan. Puerto Rico
So incomprehensible!
So very sad.
send money
send money
So awful!
Very very sad.

Necesitamos gente que contribuya en algo positivo ..en este momento no necesitamos tus comentarios destructivos .en nada ayudan...
I pray for these poor families!
are you insane or just heartless?
Idiot
I sure hope so!!! Didn't Mexico send help after Harvey?? It's the right thing to do!! I haven't heard anything from Trump yet though...
I'm only insane if my suggestion doesnt work
Heartbreaking
Maybe shattered but never beaten, let's move on viva Mexico!
And Red Cross Mexico!!

Nothing about the children still trapped inside?!? FU NYT
No parent should have to bury there child so terribly sad rip to those lost in Mexico xxxx
Prayers to these families. Wish we had a government in place that would recognize the humanitarian needs over border walls.
Pray for México
Marina Victoria Castanon

They haven't been rescued yet. I'm in MX.
Rescuers are saying to stop the drones because they need silence in order to rescue more people.
Prayers to the families of lost children and Mexico.  God bless you all.
Jesús Castillo I've been anguishing all day over those precious babies.
May God bless..all our prayers sent to all the families so sad.


Laura S Castillo looks
I've also yelled out loud at God several times today.
Please verify organizations before you donate.
 I'm so saddened by this....
The worst natural disaster will always be an earthquake, unpredictable, and no science still to warn humanity when its gonna struck.
As a parent, my heart hurts. Like, I can't imagine waiting...
I just saw that we offered help.
Los Topos Mexicanos is legit.
Jesús Castillo do you know why they can’t rescue the girl and the other two persons she said were with her? My God she can’t be there for that long ! What if she’s surrounded by dead bodies ? Omg no no I don’t want to imagine what she’s going through.
 we will stand from this once more!
Is sad so sad is a sad sad situation. May God rest their souls and bless their families
Dana Adams I never watch Univision but today I kept it on my phone cause I am dying for those kids too . . That have full coverage

The school had rebar for sure. It was a really strong earthquake. Sometimes it doesn't matter

They are still trying to rescue a little girl .. and this little girl said that she is in contact with another 5 more kids ..  praying for them.. and a succesfull rescue
Propaganda!!!!!

Rebecca Brooks I did my personal donation with them. You can double check the info on their page  topos.mx
Hay no palabras....Amor a Mexico, hoy y todadia.....Es  una pesadilla. Muy muy triste..
Yeah but blue lives matter so who cares?
Larissa: this is coming from TV coverage on the ground: there are 3 children alive and a teacher that just passed away. The rescue is very very difficult, 4 story building and according to thermal images they located the 3 children alive on level 3. It turns out they've been digging and reinforcing the structure because it's so precarious: a table is what's keeping them alive under tons of materials. After digging, when they should've reached them, they realized the kids are really under level 2, so that makes another roof to go through without collapsing the whole thing.
On the plus side, right now, at another locations they just rescued 3 persons alive, at the same time with minor injuries.
Thanks for your good thoughts for us!
All i see are hearts and tears.  The hearts are sending love.

We pray for their safetiness..
Rip
Praying for a miracle 
Adam Ross
These children!! Oh my heart is breaking. 
Amanda Phillips they are legit. Check their web page or Facebook page 
MEXICAN GOVERNMENT "WE WILL NOT DONOR THE DAMNIFIED" Political parties are protected in law to avoid donating money to earthquake victims.
Do not be a gasoline, nor smoke the bonuses wages added, more taxes or a reform to scrub people, because they approve in a day ... ..the Mexican bureaucracy .. Share with the countries to see the government that we have
Heartbroken for these families.
So sad. I can't imagine the anguish and pain these people are experiencing.
Heartbreaking.
Tx u. God bless. B
Prayers to everyone
Yes,super sad , there is one girl trapped that's still alive, I just can't go to bed until I hear she is fine. They've been trying since 9:00 am, a dog found her. She is trapped on the second floor, it was a 5 story building. She is in Mexico already like an emblema of hope + her name is also Sofia, like my daughter
They just rescued a girl!!
Tragic, God bless their souls....

Dear friends of the world and Mexicans outside of Mexico, if you want to help you can donate to TOPOS rescue group. You can go to http://www.topos.mx/ or You can make a PayPal donation to donativos@brigada-rescate-topos.org 
TOPOS is a professional non-profit Mexican rescue team. They have helped in various International Disasters. More than ever they need our support and as little as $5 will make a huge impact.   
No red cross!!!a tiny fraction of Your money would get directly to cause. Your money better utilized with Topos.  In my opinion
Happens a lot these days.. usually because their home has been bombed.

Bless the families of these poor children

Ugh. Terrible tragedy, those poor families.
Praying for the little girl alive and being rescued!!!! I read she was in contact with 5 other kids!! Please let them be rescued alive!
My hear breaks

Oh my god be with there souls. Prayers
Please pray for Mexico,  a lots of familys lost everything in Chiapas,  Oaxaca, Morelos, Puebla and Mexico City!
Some times I just don't have the energy to comment. People's ignorant comments exhaust me.
Every Mexican in the world can tell you topos.mx is legit. It is a group of people that gathered after the earthquake in 1985 to rescue people as they are doing today. Since then, they have trained and volunteered in many places all over the world in natural disasters. If you really want to help the rescue labor, Topos and Mexican Red Cross are the best options

By a natural disaster, if that's what you mean.
Mexico was hit by two very strong earthquakes in less than two weeks and is now at state of disaster. 
These kids are under the rubble of a collapsed building.
This is so sad.  Devastating.
Ill illuminate the not too distant history, parts of it, from the viewpoint that the problem of the question of how fish feeds was known. You know, your representative in Austria, a neighbor of your presidential wife, was given a document in 1991 by several pages about water some about CO2 and the assertion that in twenty years up to 30 world cities could be submerged. Depending on whether you could guess or not. Definitive is the challenge to the reader. Systems such as Echelon have been left out there. You know, the recent statement that you might be staying at the Paris Climate Convention, I do not know whether you understand the damage you have inflicted, but it is worth it, but not enough. The fact is that if the US does not participate in the implementation of the CO2 target humanity, we too Europeans, Russians, Chinese ... die. We do not have to activate nuclear weapons for retribution, which is not necessary. Chess matte.
Devastating. My heart hurts so much for those families.
Heartbreaking.  I can't even fathom this and the pain of the parents.  My utter thoughts and prayers are with them.  I don't know how they will find peace, but I pray they find comfort in the outpouring of love and compassion.  
It would really make a diference if you show people that have been helping there until exhaustion, the real heros that are risking their lives, the people of Mexico that has united to help their neighbor rather than  ignorant, photo opp pseudo president Pena - shame on you The New York Times

El sello más triste de esta tragedia.

I'm looking to find the best place to donate. Thanks for this information. I will be looking for a local place where I love in Brooklyn.
David Rosas
This info is accurate. Please help us!

Dana Adams they’re calling her parents and family that means she may be dying or quitting  my heart is aching so much
NOO! I do not accept that 
Eso es mentira no son 30 y todavía en estos momentos estan con vida adentro de los escombros 5 niños q no pueden ser rescatados xq está a punto de colapsar el edificio que está a un lado y elementos de la Marina Armada de México está pidiendo unas vigas y materiales para poder salvarlos, esto está en vivo y dejen de poner cosas falsas aunque sean de otro país New York Times NO DIGAS MENTIRAS!
Soooooo sad
 Katya Widyatmoko
God Bless all those children and their families in their time of loss and grief. Such a tragedy!

please no
Heartbreaking.
The funds donated to The Red Cross barely make it to where they are needed. Here is an example:
https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-red-cross-raised-half-a-billion-dollars-for-haiti-and-built-6-homes

I much rather donate (and have) to Topos. They are known around the world after the 1985 Earthquake and have helped many at a time of need due to natural disasters.

Pobrecitos
Sad, sad,
So deeply sorry! I saw pictures of the school that collapsed and wept. Prayers, our neighbors. We weep with you! God bless!
Thoughts and prayers...
There's a lot of confusion. "Frida Sofia" might not be her real name, either the rescuer who talked to her didn't correctly understand her name or authorities originally decided to use a fake name to protect her privacy. That might be the reason why no parents of any "Frida Sofia" are present. There's not "calling her parents and family that means she may be dying or quitting". 
Univision is one of the most unreliable sources of information in Spanish, so it might not be Larissa's fault.
Tragic...Prayers!
A lot of misinformation on the site also, a lot. Mexican TV is discussing that right now. They have interviewed rescuers on the site and they have given information that later has been found to be false.
Awwh God bless all the families. So sorry to hear about the lost of their Beauitful children. 30 new angles in heaven.
Rudy Alarcon I am not mexican, nor do I live there or have relatives or family over there , but I’m a Latina and the pain of my Latino brothers and sisters is my pain too. I am the luckiest woman to have everyone in my family alive right now Rudy .
I will keep praying
Topos have release a statement where they are saying that they are not asking for money, they don't even have an account. They do what they do because that is what they love to do. So if you're going to donate is better if is with UNICEF or other ONG
Joan Bauer Gradus, you're right! And how!...

Mexiko is full of prayers, but they can't stop earthquakes nor end poverty. Maybe they should stop with the praying and use the time to build more stable buildings instead.
So why did he kill those kids exactly?

https://www.gofundme.com/prayformexico-mexiconeedyou you can donate here
Juan Ramos yes there’s calling for them , I saw the rescuer approach the Univision reporter to tell her to call the girl’s parents or family , I just saw it with my own eyes , they need her family to be there that’s why they’re calling them , I’m not lying 
Killed?
Son más de 30 niños murieron muchos muchos  no puedo dormir
YOU CAN HELP EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT IN MEXICO. 

If you're wondering how you can help from afar please consider donating to Topos, a civilian rescue brigade that was formed during the 1985 earthquake in Mexico City. 

You can donate directly on their website (there's a PayPal account on the top left): 
http://www.topos.mx

Or directly on PayPal:
donativos@brigada-rescate-topos.org

Another way of helping is donating through Amazon Mexico, they're working directly with the Red Cross and have created a Wishlist of things people need to help:
https://www.amazon.com.mx/registry/wishlist/H4XK3LNWVOPB/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_ip_wl_o_xCKWzbYXVH2KN

Or just go directly to www.amazon.com.mx where you can purchase things directly for the Red Cross to help save lives around Mexico City and the damaged areas.

Or go directly to Mexican Red Cross:
https://www.cruzrojamexicana.org.mx

Dollars are worth almost double as the Mexican peso so even the smallest donation could go a long way.

If you can share this with any friends or family that are interested in helping, people from my city would really appreciate it.

Thank you for your help and prayers, they keep us strong in these very troubling times! 
Outliving one's child has got to be the cruelest blow life can deliver. Peace to Mexico and her heartbroken families. 
You could pray for Mexico. And we thank you! But you can, additionally or alternatively, donate and make a difference.

This very moment, there are people buried in collapsed buildings, and they need all the help they can get. "Topos" (mole, because they go underground) was created because of an earthquake 32 years ago, and today, they are hands-on in the rescue efforts. They have helped in other disasters, here in Mexico and in other countries.

Absolutely heartbreaking! 
I cannot imagine, I’m so sad for all involved. Prayers for everyone in Mexico City 

My heart goes out to the dear people of Mexico and the families who lost their children and loved ones. This is beyond imagination and the unspeakable. I lived in Mexico, in fact, in Colonia Roma which was hard hit, and I am so sad to see this. Such beautiful people. I am so sorry that this happened. Thank you for the information where we can help. Mexico lindo y querido.
Time to rough up some pathetic "engineers" and builders.
Dear international friends,

As many of you already know, Mexico suffered yesterday a really huge earthquake that made horrible damages and today I ask for your help.

I will post here 4 different alternatives on how we can help Mexico :

1.- Topos is a professional non-profit Mexican rescue team. They have helped in various International Disasters. More than ever they need our support and any donation is more than appreciated.

In Mexico:
Banco: Santander Cuenta: 92-00070929-4
CLABE: 014180920007092942
Referencia: Brigada de Rescate Topos Tlaltelolco, A.C.

To donate anywhere else via Paypal:
Go to: http://www.topos.mx/
Type the amount you want to donate on the section DONATE on the top left side of the page (Use Google Translate if unsure).
It will redirect you to Paypal's donation site where you will need to login to your Paypal account.
Donate! 

2.- For those outside of Mexico, here are all the details that you need to donate to the Red Cross:
+ Account holder name: Cruz Roja Mexicana IAP
+ SWIFT Code: BMSXMXMM
+ Account number: 0404040406
+ Domicile: Ejercito Nacional No 1032, Colonia Los Morales, Zip Code 11510

3.- Red Cross has also a wishlist in Amazon of items that are needed right now. Here is the link: 
https://www.amazon.com.mx/gp/aw/ls/ref=mh_s9_acss_cg_CR_3a1_w?ie=UTF8&lid=H4XK3LNWVOPB&ref_=mh_s9_acss_cg_CR_3a1_w&ty=wishlist

4.- This is a fundraiser Facebook group that is asking for any donation to buy supplies to all affected people: 
https://www.facebook.com/donate/420576585005843/

I think I speak in the name of Mexico by telling you that any little help is really appreciated and that we will thank you forever with all our hearts  

Also if you don't have now resources to help, you can SHARE this post so we can spread the word and maybe others can help.

THANK YOU ALL IN ADVANCE!  

Y MUCHA FUERZA A MI PUEBLO MEXICANO, NOS LEVANTAREMOS DE ESTA COMO SIEMPRE LO HACEMOS #FUERZAMEXICO

The law of nature "good and bad" will be tested in trials , there are many other building which did not fall so may be it is the people's fault? As for why the innocent kids the are like angels pure souls and only God know what would be their outcome so said the holy Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) regarding innocent cheldren and they will be as a mercy for their perents as I myself lost me baby as a test in life due to another person fault also we are going troug " changes cause by nature titonick plate adjustment and the will be effects so Man has to seek out God mercy and do what is best and worship His Lord and Creator, The One And Everliving God Allah, Ellilohim ,Yahway , Jehovah, and Hope for the best all good comes from God and evil comes from man himself thank you for asking May God Mercy be with us All Peace be unto you and all who believe

Have Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Belize, or Costa Rica? And you're so "ashamed" I can recommend you drain your bank account, sell everything you own and donate it all to the Mexican relief fund of your choice and then get on a plane and pick up a shovel and a sand bag and get to work, being so ashamed and all
Guess Ms. Popadick was asleep when this went out......http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/20/mexico-earthquake-trump-us-assistance-242947
James P Harris well, aside from those being developing nations, Costa Rica actually did send aid. She asked a good question... you know, since the US is supposed to be the most powerful nation and an actual direct neighbour to Mexico. Why such a silly response?

Randy Motes ...and what do you do to help expecting mothers keep their child? People like you care about the fetus in words in insults, but could care less about the child once it's born. It's truly repulsive that you use the death of children to spew hate. Shame on you.
Unfortunately that it's a lie 
The New York Times don't forget what the mexican government did, they manipulated the truth; Frida Sofia doesn't exist. Aristegui Noticias
Breaks my heart. How devastating
How to help
Ashley Mexico didn't hesitate to send help when the hurricane happened js no an excuse the USA simply dosent care instead of helping they trying to build a wall

That was a big lie from the rescuers and the Marina of México! What a shame :-/
Pray for Mexico 

Sincerely Sorry.. God Bless you with Love and Comfort 
God Bless
Topos say to the press today that people dont send donation to them. Because had some trouble with fake account with topos name. Send donations to the red cross insted.
Por cierto ese comentario de si te gustan los tacos, las piñatas,  etc. Es bastante estupido. Mexico no son tacos y piñatas, donen por empatia no por unos antojitos o estereotipos.
Thanxs for you good intentions, but we dont need prayers, those are useless. If you really care and wanna help make a donation.
Roberto Gonzalez II http://www.animalpolitico.com/2017/09/grupos-topos-donaciones/ 

Y que cada quien done por los motivos que quiera el fin es ayudar no criticarnos y llamarnos estupidos unos a los otros. Esa vibra es lo que menos necesitamos en estos momentos.
Topos anounced they are not taking donations. Those sites are false. Donate directly to Unicef
I know too well. Gods peace be upon them. My deepest sympathies
Wanda Williams Hobson And to you as well. 
Mexico City is broken and battered.  Thanks to the Japanese Team coming to their assistance!  God Bless!  May Our Lady of Guadalupe lift you up!

Hello I.m from suriname
I am from Brazil
Police reform in St. Louis does not exist!
Hello From KC
Hello from Northern CA
Let's get down to business, some real Criminal Justice Reform business shall we?
We have to remember that policing is actually, community policing, and there are a number of beneficial roles in the practice.
Hey Reddick!
Thank you for covering this important issue

Hello from Tennessee
Thanks for killing all of us Trump. Thank you in advance for being an atrocity.
45 has an Evil Agenda that's who he is! Evil Mad ConMan!
I'm sad about this.   I hope this discussion leads to more peace rather than simply fueling a terrible trend.  Violence/ death a few days ago in my neighborhood.   I don't feel safe.
Perhaps one way to relieve tension between police and the black community would be for members of the police to stop shooting members of the black community.
I stand with you
Where is the White face

Racial tensions !!! Are you serious ?
God bless Family
There cannot be 'Justice'' in a system by white supremacy and inequality. It is impossible. What we need to focus on is to get rid of such system.
I stand with you, also. Mary Ramsay

The criminal justice system needs change.  These discussions are important but action is needed.

In 2011, Jason Stockley, a white former police officer, fatally shot Anthony Lamar Smith, a 24 year-old black man. Last week, Stockley was acquitted of first-degree murder. Protesters took to the streets almost immediately. Comment with your questions, and read the full story here: https://nyti.ms/2x2kUXX
You all African Americans (not black) need to really stand up!! Stand up!!!!!!!
Cops broke the windows, do you know that.
Ellisville, MO
what on earth is going on in your country. its supposed to be the beacon of light and it was under Obama or thats how it appeared from this side of the world.
So How Do We Fix The Current  System?
So true, we can replace things but not people.
America has been begging for this by ignoring the real situation which is exemplified by the life and journey through hell of Kalief Browder. We are DONE, not playin', fed up and tired beyond all reckoning. Wake up racist America and CHANGE. The excuses and rationales are not going to suffice any longer.
Kentucky with you
Those who profit from racism like michael dyson,loius farahkan and al sharpton will never stop playing the race card.
Both sides my a#@
We are a mess
Redditt Hudson is the MAN!
We can only change the system by changing the people in power
Listening from Australia.
I don't understand why he was acquitted. How can life go on this way? It's immoral.
What a bunch of idiot's
Amen
Why do people use those words ''Criminal Justice'' in the same sentence... Why not ''Justice'' system rather than ''Criminal Justice system?? Am I the only one who sees this??? In a ''Criminal Justice system there cannot be ''Justice'', why? Because the Criminal will be the one whom we will be looking for to give ''Justice''. Every country in the planet, they talk about ''The Justice'' system, except USA. Consequently, it is a non-sense trying to ''actually'' get ''Justice'' in a Criminal Justice system.
Brian I'm thinking of leaving this country.      Corruption happened.      The election did not reflect who we really are.  People are scared and confused and media magnified it.
Abuse of authority. Right there.
Listening from argentine!
Sessions wants to go back to proven "war on drug" tactics that did not work and led to unfair incarceration of minorities
End the war on drugs!!!!
Not JUST "black communities."  AMERICANS are outraged...
We need deescalation training in so many sectors of our society and even on Facebook.  We need to address the foundations of racism in our country.
We'll never rid This Country of Racism. Especially when we have an Evil Racist Leader. However there is more good out there! Stand Up against Racism, it is Ugly and Evil!
How is this issue covered in curriculums in schools? Are students K-12 taught/exposed to police/community issues and proper response , no matter your race? How to address improper responses on both sides and how to learn from history? To help alleviate the tension so that there are not violent reactions. From Buffalo, New York.
America needs to STOP SCAPEGOATING MINORITIES.
As the former POTUS said, "don't get mad, vote!"  People need to participate to change the system, the law...  Too many people don't turn out and don't vote.
I can't even watch this it's making me cry.
I'm here Springfield MO.
One thing that must not be forgotten is how Jewish media and bankers are doing everything in their power to inflame the situation as much as they can. Strange that while always taking the black side in America, Israel doesn't even let blacks in.
California
Police are like a box of chocolates. They'll kill your dog. -someone with a new dog
"Civil Rights" are in some school curriculums on the East Coast. Don't know about other places.
We need the decriminalization of drugs and mandatory drug sentencing which is part of the systemic racism in the justice system. We need the prison complex to be dismantled. We need to start  putting money into rehabilitation and schools in the inner cities and suburbs creating a historic curriculum which addresses what actually happened
A fear of s change in power is exactly why republicans are fighting so hard for their redistricting and for stricter regulations on voting.
Also, change the ethos from law enforcement to service of the law. 
Police are trained to escalate a scenario. They have tazers, pepper spray and batons. Someone has a knife, taze em. 
Also stop militarizing the police.
You got the key the African American community must unite first.
Must stop
Please don't knock Jewish people either.
enough is enough grow up
What's the real cause of tension
Ok gonna LISTEN NOT COMMENT
I'd like to know it the police union and metro police will be held accountable for harassing the restaurant owner for criticizing them on social media as well.  Encouraging violence against his business is unforgivable.
It seems to me that we keep seeing Ground Hog Day because of the psychology in this country, all races, that white lives are more valuable than black lives.  We have to deal with that psychology before true progress can be made.
Yes I know
We have to do the deep work of dismantling racism and white supremacy - I agree. We are only ONE race.
Yes! Bizarre and truly insane. 
From Africa
I meant to say We need to put the  monies into rehabilitation and into the school systems to start.
Demand better training for the Police.   Weaning out those 30% of White Supremacists at the helm of the Police  and State Atorney etc.
Every kind of violence is very bad and should not happen. Every war in our history and in the present is absolutely satanic and there is really no excuse for the one elite behind (I only say familyclan Rothschild and beyond Warburg, Rockefeller, DuPont, Russell, Bundy, Onassis, Kennedy, Collins, Freeman, Astor, Li and families like Reynolds, Morgan, Vanderbilt, Bauer, Whitney, Duke, Guggenheim, Oppenheim, Grey, Sinclair, Schiff, Solvay, Oppenheimer, Sassoon, Wheeler, Todd, Van Duyn, Taft, Wallenberg, Clinton, Habsburger, Guggenheim, Goldschmidt andandand. This is a fact, we have take the power away of this luciferian people, who have the whole world in ther hands. They only act for theis plans of a new world order and are unethical, amoralic and egoistic, a special kind of bloodlinerassistic, because they only look at their own advantage. We, the normal people ob billions are a little bit like better animals for them. They are real antireligious, luciferian, devilish, satanic!). All people are absolutely equal! All countries are equal! All respectful, good religions are equal!
Why "No Teeth" to. Prosecution of obviously culpable police officers, its like the blue shield of Not an iota of  REAL 
responsibility!
Rhonda I WANT to know HOW
Why would you have this on Rosh Hashanah? Diversity and inclusion should include all community
We need to keep pushing. We cannot stop just because trump is in power.
You listen to that racist fascist come on your college professors saw you coming my friend! Lol
I love this guy
Yes! Total accountability. It's a must for everyone.
We need complete reform of the justice system in Missouri ! We have to take away the power of big money and racism out of the justice system! the law is supposed to treat everyone equally!
St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson promised to curb violence and heal racial divisions. Then a former police officer was acquitted of murder. Read the full story here: https://nyti.ms/2jJXAc4
If you notice all the luders were black yes accountability for your crimes
Peace peace peace  ----Copenhagen
We need to spend time together and enjoy each other's company. Just like bullying on the playground, we need to confront racists and let them know their behaviour won't stand anymore.
Police always need to be accountable. Always. Or it's a Police State. And that's unacceptable.
StL here, thank you Ms Jones, panel, and NYT
Hi from Bangkok
Ellisville, MO has body cameras
All we need to do is to STOP using the words ''Criminal Justice'' System. Then we will get Justice. Until then, we are wasting our time. We need to talk about ''Justice System'', not Criminal Justice. LOL,,, Lawyers, Attorneys, mothers, sons, fathers, mothers, and everyone else talk about ''Criminal" Justice system. A criminal justice system means what? it simply means the CRIMINALS run the show. So, why do we think the criminals keep on running the show? I see two things 1- Either we need to stop using ''Criminal Justice'' system words (just use ''Justice System'') or 2- We come to the realization that we cannot do anything because it is a ''Criminal Justice'' system.... I do not believe one bit, it is a mistake by putting those 2 words together. (Not a mistake at all. Let's start by saying ''Justice System''. )
Racism is institutionalized, that's why I always choose "Other" and write in "human," but you can't tackle racism and discrimination without addressing education.  Republicans will never strengthen the educational system when polls tell them their base is strongest amongst less educated or poorly educated individuals
I believe notions of white supremacy does lurk in almost all white folks. I believe it is subconscious/unconscious in folks of goodwill. I believe the difference lies in how aware a person is. Folks who have had deep awareness training are more likely to "get it." But, how many get deep levels of awareness training? Not many. To compound this deep psychology, there is evidence that shows that there is a psychology in many black communities where more value is placed on white lives than black Lives.
Indeed accountability in all states across the board also no one has brought up " who gave these police officers the orders to behave this way someone has given the go ahead for this! Governors? Mayors of these cities and or states? No one has asked nor answered this question
Janet, that's not true
Rhonda this may sound lame but I wish we had the Oprah Winfrey show still.    I think it was uniting and promoted peace and social progress and understanding
We have to uncover for white folks of goodwill, their deep hidden notions of white supremacy.
The first police officers in the U.S. were put in place to protect the wealthy white man's belongings and property and I think that's still their purpose.
Get behind one candidate - one agenda - STL first!!
Racism does not occur in almost all white folks. I'm proud to say I have great relationships with human beings of all sizes, shapes and skin tones.
Complete and Total Transparency  No more Murder
Janet where are you from if you don't mind me asking.  I do not feel this in NYC
The way I see it, there are two ways to change public sentiment. A revolution would provide a drastic change but is highly risky. Or society can begin by upholding morals and accountability step by step beginning with education, compassion, and humanity.
Race baiting is so 20th century
Yes!!!!!!
Sorry Janet your insights got cut of...
Daniel when we see the role models in power I feel hopeless that anything will work but revolution
How do you dismember this continual "cover up" by the  Police?  They protect the bad apples.
John J Cannon Your comment is so 1950s
Police ranks need to be culled and rewards for weeding out the the bad apples & repopulate the ranks that more reflect the community being served.
"Ours and theirs". That attitude is a seed for conflict.
Don't give her another opportunity to talk about what she'd do if she was Mayor. She lost, so it doesn't matter. What will she do as a private citizen is a better question?
Oh Geez I confused Janet and Rhonda.   I'm tired.
Why aren't these "disgusted by the verdict" cops speaking out against their "blue brothers" that are brutalizing civilians?! Where are they? If they are out there- WHY AREN'T THEY SPEAKING OUT against these violent riot cops? Why?
When a cop kills anybody they should have the trial in a different city to begin with. Plus there should be a thorough investigation by a non police body selected by the community. There should never be police policing the police. They are no different than any other gang on the street. They protect their own. The Blue Line, the Blue Bloods.
I have really been an advocate for black citizens in any city against police brutality and profiling of black citizens i might add that I am white I am against any persons rights being violated but black persons really are harassed and when someone is killed or beating down there is absolutely no accountability the media also tries to put white people against black people too and that needs to stop!
Should really separate races into separate states
Hello from Sanford, Florida! I'm white and I'm with you! I'll march by your side with you.
All blacks get new york
Peace is key.  Everyone wants more and everyone wants.  That is the problem.
Whites to west virginia
BLM
Hispanics Arizona
Why don't the "good cops" intervene and protect citizens?  Why don't they stop the "bad cops" and arrest them or stop abuse rather than cover it up?
Want not waste not.
That is the truth! This is what has been going on it is just getting filmed now!
Opportunity! Yes!
What do you want?
AMEN address the need for community outreach and support and LOVE
“On Aug. 9, 2014, Mike Brown was killed by Darren Wilson, a police officer in the St. Louis suburb Ferguson, Mo. […] Three years later, change the names to Anthony Lamar Smith and Jason Stockley, and here we are again.” Read Nicole D. Nelson’s full piece in The New York Times Opinion Section here: https://nyti.ms/2ycNK4T
sdominy
Stop with that so silly
Yes
The cruelty needs to stop and justice prevail.
Exactly that's what people say and their always saying that when discussions like this take place that it is to fuel more violence and that is simply not true the purpose of these discussions is to open people eyes to this terrible unacceptable behaviors
Make #ChristiansAgainstTrump a thing.
JC cannon - this is not a wages conversation.
Our community must be educated on the history of slavery - the role of the  police in maintaining slavery and capturing run away slaves.  Also teach what lead to the civil rights movement and specially teach "Civics".  After school, after church find time to educate our own community!!
When are the "good apples" in the PD going to take a stand? Join the protest. Support humanity?
My lineage dates back 65,000 years I was a black man and brown man and nature made me white.  I think this whole racist talk is disgusting.  We are one people and let's try not to divide let's try to unite.  Come on already.
No John cannon but poverty wages don't get you beat up for walking down the street with a hoodie in either! Or riding a bike down the street or buying a pack of ciggs on the corner
Alexandria Lane they are terrified.   That's why people keep quiet. ???????
Black on black crime is not an argument. We all should care that folks are dying and ask what are those things that have changed in those communities where young people are devaluing themselves and devaluing others. If we spent more time caring and asking questions rather than judging and condemning, the answers and solutions would reveal themselves. We have to get past the cultural deep convictions that a white life is worth more than a black life.
You get institutionalised racism, inequality, and fascism from the control of capital by oligarchs. The dominant institutions today is the corporation. But corporation are undemocratic. They filter wealth away from everyday people, and creates a sense of scarcity, and how do you justify violence and distrust? By intimidation. Intimidation of minorities and by criminalising people through sanctimonious attitudes, creating an us and them mentality through religious, classist and political divide.
Protests continued for a fourth day in St. Louis after a former police officer who fatally shot a black man was acquitted. Here’s a look at what happened: https://nyti.ms/2jCwzHq
I would like to know:   What about white on white crime? -% of people kill by police  by race.
John Cannon deal with the current reality.
Let's get all these racists out!
I am sending love from north central Saskatchewan, to all of you. We have to be one human race.
Missouri is 83% White 11% Black...Fact! Republican Controlled State. Nothing will ever change in Missouri. The Blacks here that can leave the state should leave and go to more diverse States. Missouri is not a state for Blacks. Justice for blacks will never happen in Missouri. My opinion only!
I just pray I don't know what else to do
John J Cannon It is important we have discussions such as this. We must listen to each other and understand one another. I get your point that we are one but before we get to that we must settle our differences and understand our humanity. Unfortunately, we are not at that point yet.
Yes and the Fraternal order of police are bullies who stand behind these officers knowing full well they are guilty they even threaten any officials who intend to prosecute the guilty officers 
I'm in
Deflection, deflecting, deflectors- the arguments against the obvious is already planned beforehand.

We are suppose to protect not cover for each other like a street gang
Police job is to bring people to justice not to judge and execute the death penalty!!!
A jury of 12 said not guilty it's the law follow it  not happy with the verdict move to a different country
I wasn't a jury trial
Thank you for watching, everyone. Keep the conversation on race going by using the hashtag #racenyt and tweeting at John Eligon (@jeligon) and Rachel Swarns (@rachelswarns), or emailing them at racerelated@nytimes.com.
Good panel -  ask NPR STL public radio for space!!
The St Louis police don't seem clear on their mission.
Move to Canada. Problem solved.
Thank you for this!
Thank you
Nicely done, people!
Jane here from Springfield.
Police need training indeed, they need to be trained to enforce the law even if it means arresting another officer for abuse
And thank YOU! Have a great evening!
Thank you!
Let's keep talking about race
Then hire all minority cops.
Jimbo, you crack me up brother!
You white supremacist should be the first to go!
Likewise we are for sure not on the same page politically man! I think thats clear based on your comment about the biggest race divider that ever was!
Y el ispano que mataron en oklahoma ese no cuenta o que
Michael Brown was not corrupted???? Louis Farrakhan not corrupted???? Al Sharpton not corrupted???? Michael Dyson not corrupted???? As far as the election goes Hillary Clinton not corrupted????
Its part of making a civil war happen so they can impose martial law upon the US citizens
Jhc sometimes a criminal is just  that   Most police officers are doing their best  why don't we question the action of the person shot
Disobedience has been the biggest factor in police shootings. Listen and obey. Change your attitude, save your life.
There is just as much white crime! White crime is not reported like black crime. Who do you think is killing all the white kids with the Heroin and Meth in Saint Louis...  White drug dealers!!
How about the criminal element in the  black community stop glorifying gangs, gang rape, greed, murder, hate and violence! All workings of evil. How about race pimps like Michael " the chump" Dyson, al " steals money from the offering plate at the AME church" Sharpton, Maxine " evil God haters" Waters and Louis " I hate christians and Jews" Farrakhan actually promote positive works rather than profiting off evil works!! How about that!!
Don't practice psychology. You only look foolish with your false assumptions, mentally incapacitated, mentally unstable, devoid of any intellectual and rational thought, know it all about nothing kookness.
Treasurer Jones thank you yet again for being the leader you are!! My condolences to you and your family!
Bill Henderson  This is just your rejection and denial showing. It's okay. I understand.

#RecallKrewson
There are other ways to still the behavior without stilling the human being.
Yes ma'am, implement The Ferguson Commission' recommendations beginning with their principal directives.
Militarized police are really hard to control. Thanks to Trump they all have a license to brutalize the public. How handy.
@Bill Henderson...You White Supremacist kkk are disgusting!
Where is the white guy? Smfh
Bill Henderson Look up the case of Kelly Thomas in Fullerton, CA. He was beaten to death by two cops while four others watched. Please go look now. You can't tell if he's black or white by the way he looked when they were done with him. He did not resist. The cops were acquitted but the city had to by 5 Million dollars, the whole ordeal was on surveillance camera.
Donna, so the Ferguson riots happened when trump was president??
But are you working to change the institutions that give advantages to people with white skin? Do you recognize white privilege?
His mother got 1 million, his dad got 4 million and that is what it takes to get things to change. Hefty settlements for those left behind.
St. Louis City and County Police can't distinguish a riot from a strategic, organized group of demonstrators! We saw it tonight Reddit! Violations of demonstrators' First Amendment Rights violated on live streams, FB Live....STL County stopped demonstrators from walking on sidelines and public space tonight!
I'm sorry. Tremendously deep shifts are occurring in our nation, and of course it is frightening.
We are actively pursuing #RecallKrewson so St Louis City can have the right leader as you see before you!!!!
People have different views and that's ok. Especially when they have been friends for 30+ years. You don't have to agree with each other's views but respect each other...you slackers...jk
Jay, James and I agree on a lot and disagree on a lot but we're good friends for sure!
Glad to hear.
Jay, James and I are good!  We disagree on some things, agree on others but we are friends for sure!
The MMM was about addressing our own violence. And that was the largest civil rights march ever! We can walk (talk about our own crimes) and chew gum (protest unjustified police violence against) at the same time.
Actually I think some of what we are experiencing is the backlash against the progress we made.
All is not lost. The people who voted for Obama are still here. Life-long progressives and activists are still here. Enduring progress takes a lot of time. Black and white people of good will are still here, though under a lot of pressure and competing claims.
bah!  I thought my first reply didn't post!  Hah!
As a retired Mpls officer, thank you for what you are doing.
Yes!
Yes, totally agree,
Plenty of white people play their own "race cards" too.
Yes!
Mary, perhaps. My point here is as long as there is money to be made in dividing races, not just black and white, there never will be an end of those who profit from racism.
I think you're very right that we need to hear more information. I would love to see s really well done credible fact-finding, trusted and prominently discussed. And then using those facts identify as best we can the issues and have,  Redditt (sp)? says, sn accountability. As a former reporter here in the San Francisco Bay area, we have seen many demonstrations, primarily in the Eastbay around Berkeley and Oakland. I have watched very angry white young people apparently with a ax to grind that may not necessarily be what the current clinical debate is about, just tear through downtown businesses and tear things. They said that was their intention. Recently in Berkeley there was a group of so called anarchists - I hate to distinguish them with any kind of title - that just delighted in breaking things up. Ironically they call themselves the black block. Not many of them are black. There has to be very careful unraveling of all of the issues that contribute to this continuing violence. What could be more egregious than the obvious killing of an unarmed  black person by A police officer. Yet again and again we see that there is always some little questionable event, which releases the police officer from responsibility. We have got to have a super commission, interracial, highly respected, that can produce a thorough investigation, not just  a specific crime but of the overall if what I'm hearing you call institutional racism. And once and for all have a solid document, verifiable and acceptable to everyone so we can begin to resolve this horrible horrible series of unjust killings.
I think we need to deal with the psychology at the same time as pushing. Things are really in a bad state, and any apparent faltering or holding back will embolden the powers of racism, violent repression and hate.
I have empathy for that wish, but first the wounds must be aired and be healed. Otherwise they will fester.
Absolutely!
Yes, coverage is very biased. That serves the White power structures.
Ah.... Quit committing crimes. That helps in 99% of all police shootings.
Stepped in a minefield there
All this because of Trump politic mind against poor people and colored skin.
All good either way they are all some what puppets to the powers that be
Yes. I think many international accords have been reached in this way. Also with Justice and Reconciliation Commissions.
Yes!!
False deflection and no you do not understand. How can you since you are devoid of any intellectual and rational thought, mentally unstable, mentally incapacitated, know it all about nothing and contribute nothing except to regurgitate msnbc-Rachel mad cow- Berkeley nazi talking points. Good luck in your bipolar, uninformed, uneducated world. And yes I do reject such a world. What a depressing, worthless, sad state of existence that world must be.
As Al Capone said you can steal more with a fountain pen than you can with a gun.....
As public officer he has to defend all' not only the withe....
Mary Ramsay  I agree. I would not suggest holding back. I am merely pointing out the depth of the problem and hurdles ahead. Peace.
I am white, 65 yrs old and am utterly sad that there is not yet equal justice for all.
Bill Henderson  I have checked out your wall. Everything about you is revealed there. You dwell in a world of narrow small minded ideology and delusions of superiority.  I have no time for your nonsense. Take it somewhere else.
Ryan lake. Not funny. Please read what the discussion here about.
So you have the hands up don't shoot in Ferguson that was proven a lie now you have another criminal heroin  dealer that was killed, these aren't non violent protests, 100 % of these speakers are black, isn't this racist commentary. One commentator blames other blacks for running and watering down the vote. Many blacks have never felt more danger of walking down streets of a primary white neighborhoods, yet won't walk down streets in predominantly streets in black neighborhoods.
Terry Williams  and you can follow
If I was a cop and a 300 pound person surrendered him and he wouldn't cuff up no reasonable person would let go until he was in cuffs
Terry Williams Thats both not true and its a lie. Black males between the ages of 16 and 40 are responsible for 50% of violent crime- do the math
How would this cop handled Garner? I bet he has never let someone go unstrained, especially someone that was 300 lbs. if you were a cop was Micheal Brown's hands up when he was shot? Why was his blood in the cruiser? Did witnesses lie in their reports, if you don't speak out against these lies you are corrupt.
That's right God said, " Do you not know that the wicked will not enter into the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor drunkards, nor thieves, nor slanderers, nor swindlers will enter into Heaven!! 1 Corinthians 6:9. Jesus said, " likewise unless you repent and are born again you cannot see the kingdom of Heaven".
I think this conversation was worth a listen.
The war on drugs is the big one. Everything evil about cops, stems from that policy. 
Cop shootings. 
Gang violance. 
Mass incarceration. 
Broken homes. 
Ghettos.
How come white people dont riot when a cop shoots a white boy?   Hum maybe they were just doing their job? Ya think????
How about STOP BREAKING THE LAW!!!!
Obama 
Bye.
About 22% of People killed by cops this year are black, 16% of the population is black, what  % of cops are white? Is it more likely a black person would be killed by a white cop? Yes. Is it also true that a white person would be killed by a white cop? Yes. Proportionally is a white person more likely to kill a black person? No. Proportionally is it more likely a black person will kill a white person? Yes, does that make all blacks racists? No, when you add all non-whites in the equation in St. Louis, whites are the minority, since they are a minority they can't be racist
•Truth doesn’t grow Old..
it Marches On!  
-with, or without You - ->
 Keep the Faith, brthr- C’ya when We get There!
Thank you so much for this. So many important points made here. I am encouraged, especially by Redditt's optimism and hope for our community. We have to come together.
There are many, many thousands of police officers in this country, and the great majority of them are very good and honorable men.  The percentage of black men being killed by police officers is extremely low.  This judge ruled by the letter of the law and the evidence, and as a result found that the officer was not guilty.  You march against policemen without knowing the facts, but when black men kill their own day after day you don't protest, you do nothing.

Perhaps the Police department will retire their fire arms for one week in solidarity with the citizens of your City as well as volunteer for overtime in the form of benevolent street patrol where they can answer questions to the public?  Thank - you New York Times for brokering meaningful dialogue.
So says the bipolar, mentally unstable, mentally incapacitated, definitely devoid of any intellectual and rational thought, delusional, confused, vile, uninformed, misinformed, uneducated, without common sense, wisdom, and is without purpose and worth. You and your anrifa nazis would do well to check into a Dr. Kevorkian clinic and assume room temperature for the good of civilized people and society. You are worthless and have no value in society.  Not because you're a woman and white or even a liberal, it's because you are just plain ignorant beyond repair  and really dumb
It was a bench trial... no jury
I'm With you...what would you have me do ?
This is not a panacea -- but there are too many culturally incompetent mostly White police officers in predominantly Black communities.  What about a more culturally diverse trained officers including more women officers?
Ok Bill.    .    I am guessing you disagree with what i said?  ( I  can't tell .). Either I'm just tired, or your comment is ...a little hard to decipher.

In any case,  stay safe and let's hope the madness will end.   That's all I care about.

Yeah   because before Obama racism was never a thing. You idiots bare sickening. You are mad because Obama brought to light what you were perfectly okay with continuing in this country. Obama actually experienced racism as did every other POC in this country. Sorry u will never get to pretend racism doesn't exist in this country. Oh Shah Shahje ShahjehanSzc and this guy is NOT your friend. He'd defend the cops if he watched them shoot u down for no reason, right in his face.

Maybe if ppl will stop committing crimes, policemen will stop shooting. And that, will even stop innocent ppl being shoot by mistake, or fear.
Yes Jon and address the white on white crime while you're at it
Tishaura for everything!
Please harp on the clashes. They are tear gassing regular people and beating them on the ground.
Actually Sandra if a black man kills a black man they will be tried to the fullest extent of the law.  Not the same if a police officer does it, hence our discussion. And if you think there really isn't a problem, and you're only looking at the "low" stat of black men killed by police, look at how many white men are killed by police. Numbers don't lie, stop denying the problem and join the discussi n on how to rectify it
You're my mayor.
Lyda Krewson was cowardly when she cancelled those.
Accountability and Transparency! follow the professional example of nurses.
She was endorsed by the white police union only. We have two. And they are segregated.
Krewson absolutely hasn't balanced her support.
Preach.
We need officers to cross the blue line publicly and together.
And audit the hell out of their spending.
Thank you Tishaura.
I work in an institution where we address exactly what you query me about. And of course I recognize white privilege. It's pervasive. That does not mean "most" white folks are racist. We won't dismantle this very problem if all we do is make blanket statements about people. We need to sit around campfires or in town halls, or over a game of cards and - get to know each other. As human beings.
I too am a retired officer and rode with Redditt, a great guy Glad to hear you speak out!!
Practicing peace takes skills not everyone has ; ....first it takes everyone ...all citizens... to commit to non violence ...
There is a spirit into acting non violent ; one that empowers and bonds with others practicing peace
Justice ; for all means just that ; and not for the few Honor those who risk by acting for peace .
Honor those whose intent to keep the situation safe 
...and take the time to really listen to others ; sometimes just knowing your being heard is key to transformation
Yes disgusting is an understatement!!!
Policemen are disgusted calling  off sick.. working 12 hours no off days ..They feel betrayed cleaning up the mess with stockley s not guilty verdict
Would you speak out against your employer?
When i was an officer I
 didn't need deescalating classes but there were plenty of officers that need it, the pd hAs to take a stand and get rid of rogue cops
Maybe if people stopped dealing and using heroin they would have a better relationship with the rest of society as a whole, not just with the police.
Mike Brown wasnt killed- he was shot in the commission of a felony....
Well, Donna Lee Hungerford... We are waiting for an answer...
Deirdre Thorpe, I'm with ya about I wish it would all end but it won't. To many people profit and make a successful living profiting off of division and taking advantage of racism.
Everyone's a lawyer. The guy was selling heroin and smashed his car 3 times as he was fleeing the scene. If he was white it's a non story
The bottom line is the police officer was not convicted because of the evidence.  Has anyone of the protestors read the verdict? No one should be convicted unless the evidence shows that. It is called due process. Doubt it but thought the officer should have been convicted because police had killed a black man another time. Amazing!
If anyone does not comply and acts in an aggressive manner so that police fill threatened, they are responsible for the outcome.
Is there a police code or some form of retaliation that prevent black officers from speaking out against the senseless murders committed by officers
This is horrifying...police waiting for people to come out of a building to tear gas them????????? WHAT?????
Yes you are right about we'll never get rid of racism. To much money to is made off of dividing races in this country. Al Sharpton, Michael Dyson, Jeremiah Wright and Louis Farrakhan will not let  stop preaching victimhood as long as they prosper and achieve status from it.
Please don't deflect with that white supremacist nonsense, it has no place in this discussion, or any other for that matter

they don't for two reasons
1) statistically police brutality happens more frequently per capita to innocent black individuals than white
2) there is an established history of a lack of punishment for police brutality against black individuals, particularly when compared to white individuals

Nobody is saying that police brutality against whites people isn't also reprehensible, but the protests aren't generally JUST about one incident. It's about protesting a system in which black individuals are far more likely statistically to be victims of police brutality, and far less likely to get justice.

Broaden your scope of view and you'll see it
Because nothing protects white people's property than killing 2x the amount of whites than blacks...?
1) many, many, MANY black individuals killed in police brutality acts were never involved in any crime whatsoever.
2) even in the few cases where a crime actually was committed in the first place, do you really think it's a good idea to allow police officers to act as judge jury and executioner? minimum force should ALWAYS be used, regardless of what you think of the suspect. That's literally why the judicial system exists - to verify reasonable doubt, and to make sure the sentence matches the crime. Not every crime (particularly nonviolent crimes like drug possession) merits the death penalty. You know, like, 8th amendment and all that fun stuff?
.  Yeah.  I'm choosing to avoid media today.   Call or meet up with people instead of texting.    If media were off our phones think how much better our moods would be.
( I'm about 40).  Remember the dial up phones, the bicycles in the park, running around, climbing trees and home by 7 for dinner.     That's the world I miss.
Bill Henderson congratulations on your racist, completely inaccurate rant; you are a huge part of the problem..
I love the show of diversity of your program .
What diversity ?
I know instead of teaching your children to kill cops maybe you should teach them to respect cops .
Bull
Do you support L sharpens call to kill policeman
Sorry, you are
So wrong! There is no excuse to act violently and riot and behave badly because someone gets shot while breaking the law... If they were not being criminals the cops would not be after them, and they wouldn't get shot in the first place! End of story....
like so many levels of our current government, the people speak and so many of our elected officials go deaf.
Is it true that while the national murder rate is 5 per 100K, in STL the national murder rate of blacks is 9 in 100K..does that not tell US something is very wrong?
Doesn't the 2007 FBI report on members of racist organizations joining our police departments speak volumes about this issue?
Racism is the cancer which is consuming our very souls.
You're the Peoples Mayor Tishaura!
It doesn't help when our elected officials like Krewson and McCaskill are more concerned about votes than speaking truth about this situation.
Doesn't it speak volumes when laws are being introduced to stop the video recording of police officers and making it legal to drive thru protesters that the powers that be are not concerned about justice?
Alycia Mueller Exactly.
What does 45 have to say about this injustice? 
Justice is never served against police killing innocent black men and women.
Angela Lockhart Fisher, congratulations on your ignorant, bigoted, 100% false, 100% devoid of any intellectual and rational thought comment.  When you state false accusations and slander not only do you look ignorant and foolish you just expose yourself as a non-thinking individual who is incapable of independent thought. You are the problem   Feel free to continue to be hustled by Louis Farrakhan and his minions. Do you realize how ignorant you are being hustled and feed a lie by evil people??????? I'm not the problem. You definitely are due to your blind mentally. You are being played by workers of evil.
Why do you think judges and juries refuse to convict officers that shoot and kill black men in cold bold, and accept defenses that are based on obvious fabrications?  Is racism the principal factor at work?
Awesome conversation thank everyone involved.
Lots of stupid going around. Just like when that Mike Brown thug was killed or even Trayvon Martin. Its really simple. If you dont want to get shot then dont break the law and obey the instructions of law enforcement. Funny how that works. If you really dont want to get shot then move out of cities governed by democrats ie: chicago, baltimore, detroit, etc etc etc
Gee I'm shocked 
The Ferguson Riots happened because of a racist District Attorney and Police Officers. Not to mention a Rogue White Supremacist coward Cop in St Louis County!
It could have been handled much better if real human beings had been in charge- Not white supremacist!
YES THEY ARE, VERY WELL ORGANIZED! WE HAVE 142 MORE DAYS OF AN ECONOMIC BOYCOTT
YES BY LEAVING THEM ALONE!
There's a spirit of lawlessness and injustice in the St. Louis region that permeates from the State, City and local government
Conflict always derives from the misunderstanding.
It most certainly is!  And corporate interests

How does one get in touch to pitch their brands or ideas?
II am in possession of a Wrangler unlimited year of construction 2015. I bought a new mobile phone (ONEPLUS T3) and found that it is not recognized by the navigation device. Because Jeep also support APPLE, the first question that mattered to me was whether there would be communication when the visibility was turned off. This was the case. The solution is to enter the communication PIN of the mobile phone on the navigation system. The phone does not appear on the display of the devices found at this time. Pressing the pairing button initiates a push command and the device is recognized on the mobile phone (The phone must be visible and in search mode). Now you can make the clutch as usual. I'm sure this problem has been investigated by really intelligent minds and no solution was found. The fact is based on a restriction in binary mathematics. As I said, if they do not recognize the problem by the processing, I can make it a little easier, but do not explain. Take an Internet connection. Say they want behind a radio station, for example, between two houses cope with and in the second house again a Wireless Network make available. The basic condition that this works is that you enter the name resolution (DNS entry) in the router of the second house manually. Binary it is not possible to do this dynamically. But I would like to ask you something. They are aware that economic espionage is being pursued. Do you believe that, as in the case of the subject, for example, provided my knowledge is not universal, a person should be able to solve the problem?

Last night we fed over 300 people and gave hot coffee for those helping in the rescue. I was overwhelm with the response of the people. Rich and poor, dark skinned and light skinned come together to help out. People that typically sell tacos, gorditas, quesadillas... were giving out free food for those that were helping to remove the bodies from the rubble and debris. I have never felt anything like this in my life. I want to remind people one thing, what makes Mexico great is not the money... but is our people who come together to push us up. so far over 300 people are dead, including children.

Mother nature saying shes had enough?
No no no no!
FRIENDS OF THE WORLD

Topos is a rescue team that was formed during the 1985 earthquake in Mexico. Created by a group of young Mexican Men and Women that helped rescue people in the aftermath of a massive earthquake that killed 10,000 people. Yesterday, at their anniversary, Mexico suffered another catastrophic earthquake that already has taken the life of at least 140 people with hundreds more trapped within the rubble of the collapsed buildings including children....

YOU CAN HELP EVEN IF YOU ARENT IN MEXICO. Your money is worth almost double in Mexico, so something as small as $15, £10, 50 aed has a big impact. If you feel like making a donation, even a little one, you can do it directly here:

Paypal: donativos@brigada-rescate-topos.org

NYT, I'd like to ask you a favor: please, mention in your notes that México has never seen such an overwhelming response from the population. All across the Country, support has been constant in a way some of us haven't seen before. The blow was hard, but the people has shown such compassion and sacrifice, such solidarity and empathy that now, more than ever, make me PROUD to be a Mexican. FUERZA, MÉXICO!!!

4.- This is a fundraiser Facebook group that is asking for any donation to buy supplies to all affected people: 
https://www.facebook.com/donate/420576585005843/

I think I speak in the name of Mexico by telling you that any little help is really appreciated and that we will thank you forever with all our hearts

How long does the charge last?
Sorry if you've covered this--What can you tell us about battery life?
No thanks
Still love my 6S
Brian :) you reporting now? :)
How well does the stand-alone cell function work on the watch?
I have a 7s. Should I get the new one?
Will the iPhone 8 work with T-Mobile ? I heard it wouldn't.
How does the smaller iPhone 8 compare size-wise to the iPhone 5?
Can you demonstrate wifi sharing for us with the two devices.
Ordered the Watch - series 3 GPS only. Has been shipped and will be here Friday.
Can i use the series 3 watch without having to purchase an Iphone, even if i'm only using it as a health monitor.
Farhad basically summed up everything with his critique. I am going to rock with my 6s
Worth going to the 8 if you have a 6s???
I heard 10 is coming out
My iPhone 7!has numerous issues! I hate it
So, still can't charge & listen to music via earphone, right?

When is 10 coming out
The 8 is pointless
Do gift me the phone! Love the phones and computers.
lol the ipohne 7 is a slow impovement to the 6^^ you lie
Who cares about phones
I'm definitely looking for a better camera. So in your suggestion I have a 6 and would it be worth to just go into the 7 and wait for the 10 when it's better?
iPhone 6 is just fine people
Why have they not released iPhone 9?
you suck
Watching from Columbus Ohio
still love my 6s .. maybe i could change my iphone with "iphone 20" in daa future imaoo .. 
I mean how much money does Apple want to make off loyal customers
Answer my question
When is the iPhone going to have a stylus????
if you have never owned an apple watch before is the apple watch 3 worth it iim a tri athlete and how would it compare to my garmin?
So true!
This is a ridiculous live coverage
I have no interest in a new iPhone. I like my 6.
Where is iPhone 9?
good The New York Times
I LOVE the 6s. Waiting for this stuff to get glitches out
Don’t think the 8 is pointless. Way faster than 6 or 7. Some new features.  Not the X which represents the future.
What other differences between 8 and 10
update to iphone 25 maybe
Same characteristics on the Samsung s6
Americans : we are stupid
It's too expensive!!! Everything I can control do on the Apple I already do on my android. Meh!
Don't buy the iPhone 8 if you have the 7. Just wait & buy the iPhone X
why do I need it? It is very expensive.
So it's really like a "7S" eh?  How much faster is X going to be, over 8?
The wireless charger is not included
Folks : just be happy with what you've got
apple is too stupid to count
Marco Pontual
The 8 is similar price to Android
Have you noticed significant differences in camera or video production??
Organic led who cares
Note 8 eats them alive.
And it updates itself to death so you have to buy a new one! Yaaaay!
Not eating my phone even if organic
which apple bougth from samsung
Should I update to iOS
Should I update to IOS 11
OK the Watch 3-series may be something worth considering
Can't beat s7edge - Apple r crap
Hey peeps hang up this is a waste of time
iPhone 7 plus with 32 gigs  I can get the 8 plus with 64 g  for $ 250 with trade in. Should I do it for faster speed?
If you want to charge and listen to music at the same time you need to buy an adapter from Apple! The after market ones don’t work!  Another way for Apple to make money You have to buy theirs!
It's like my Samsung Galaxy S6+ minus the Edge.  What a joke.
If I'm deciding between the iPhone 7 and 8, is the 8 worth the extra $$?
If I buy a Apple Watch should I get the gps version?
Hey Apple: how about make your devices IN AMERICA hello???!
Is there any specific Sim card required to the  Appel watch 3  ?!
The cost of the watch with lte isn't much more. Can you purchase the lte watch and not pay to use the lte?
I'd be willing to pay $1K for new iPhone IF MADE IN AMERICA hello??!!
Is it 802.11ac or ac wave 2?
Looks good
Are they waterproof i mean are they usable deep in waters
Bluetooth speakers will solve your problem

Thanks for answering my question!

I would go for note 8 not convincing
What fantastic new products. I'm buy one or two of them
David Lindsay Then don't watch.
Americans,  YOU MUST CONSUME! CONSUMPTION OF THE RARE EARTH ELEMENTS in these phone is MANDATORY. Support the fascist Trump extremists
I have been using Andriod since my first smart phone and my husband is trying to convince me to switch to iPhone. Which iPhone would be best for me to switch if I decide to go that route?
Apple doesn't seem to be coming up w/truly new & amazing, practical products anymore. Sad.
How much are they?
can you have a case with wireless charging?
Is the camera in the X worth an upgrade from 7Plus?
Is there an advantage to wireless charging?
Uninteresting recycling of old concept, Nokia disease. Apple should come up with something genuinely new.
Hello too many incompatibilities geez
Ordered my 8 plus
Is there a GPS Apple Watch?
is there any kind of charger that comes with the phone?  I don't want to have a mat AND the charger I have for my watch.  That's a bit much
CONSUMPTION OF SLAVER LABOR MADE PRODUUCTS IS MANDATORY
Stop talking about carriers a holes

Hey peeps buy a TIMEX at Walmart
I have a 6 should I upgrade to the 8 Plus or wait for the X?
Their new saucer building is fresh, but that was overseen by Jobs... & the yacht.
My iphone 6 plus screen behaving erratically after iOS11 update. Sometime  half of the screen becomes dim
I like the wireless charging so I don’t ruin the port on the phone.
Cool
Wireless charging? His is it work overseas or in Europe?
People DESERVE to be "Apple-Picked"
I have a first gen watch, is the new series 3 watch worth the upgrade?
Cool
They should go back to the 30 pin connections
Who the fck cares.
Wow
Very informative guys. Thanks for explaining this to us
wait ten years maybe
Two lenses or one.... just tuning in.
I prefer Apple, but innovation level, isn't in the same category anymore.
Question : what's next after iPhone 10?
new feature that needs the most improvement right off the bat?
It's amusing to see how many crabby people are posting.
Does iOS 11 maps have the speed limits enabled yet?
When is the 8 available in the UK? Bobbi
Plus has two lenses
Waiting for the X
Slow down, for those of us slow learners
Just tuning in 
How can I take anything Farhad says seriously?  The man believes one space after a sentence is correct.
Question : will Apple move manufacturing to the US o A? POTUS says we must do that hello!!!!
Now the "Old Lady" is shilling for Apple??? Sigh.....
So that's why my iPhone 5 is being slow and having issues....strategic planning on Apples part to piss me off enough that I'd be interested in buying a new iPhone!  No thanks....
Does iOS 11 maps have the speed limits enabled yet?
How about being able to see the screen in the sun!
No headphone or auxiliary jack
Crap my is iPhone 6 is running low on juice ; sorry hanging up
Does the orientation of the dual cameras make a difference? i.e. verticle vs horizontal
Hello from Indiana, Never had one of those,
The watch will be very good medically. In cardiac arryhthmias the initiation and termination are important in the diagnosis and treatment! Big deal I predict! And a watch can be worn day after day after day.
let's see how many times we can say "um"
Was video significantly better?
Um
*apple
Um
Can I have your demo phone? 
so I'm better off just using charger that comes with phone
Question : why biometrics for unlocking phone -- it's not like our devices are high clearance zones
shouldn't buy wireless charging pad?
What are the differences between the old and new watch?
Good one Carolyn.. how about bring able to see the screen on bright sun!
Um
Are they still available for cable charging?
Is wifi ac wave 1 or wave 2?
Do you think wireless charging will ever happen over the air like radio so you can turn off and on charging when you want
Fitbit + IPhone 7 = perfection
The watch might be altered for medical purposes to make an actual EKG. Otherwise the patient has to wear a very cumbersome EKG wires and can’t shower etc
TY! Very informative!
Bonjour
Pretty useless
Is the heart rate monitor precise enough? If someone perspire much, is the heart beat reliable?
Plz go for iPhone X
I like to watch and make fun of a holes like you
Yes you should
AWOT
What makes that phone better than the Galaxy 8?
The design was Chinese : POTUS put a stop to it 
David Alexander Lindsay Watching and making fun is the true sign of an a-hole!
Are they still abusing children and fair labor practices? Asking for a friend.
Now that's an idea!!
Apple is price gouging us American suckers : peeps, we don't NEED to upgrade it's all in our heads
Mark A PB look at this
Ok... lol. Thank you.
They really did a mediocre job just saying
Number One IPhone 8 The Best
But not year after year because Apple will make you upgrade
Does iwach can make calls to android devices or iOS only
This video is way too long. Not gonna Watch it
You’ll have to but the charging pad! Another expense
Not in my opinion
Um
Uhhh
Ordered the Watch 3 the day it opened up. Iphone X will be ordered as soon as it is available.
Like, y'know?
Apple calls it an iPhone '10', rather than 'X'.
Vive l'écologie
Shubham Agrawal  Thank you very much. I'm old. Will it be faster or have more memory?
a 4K ULTRAHD Sportscamera for 100$ with amazon  20 Mega pixels
Eileen Bushell yes but I have to buy cords as it is now. They break too easily so I end up buying more expensive ones.
I have 6  too and all antiprivicy at zero and like zuckenberg a sticker
Stick with Android. You can be boss. Apple rules. Its annoying. Speaking as someone who started with Apples and now has an Android for first time.
Yes
Well, in terms of pure horsepower, both the iPhone 8 and X have the new A11 chip, which is outperforming the S8 chip by about double, according to various benchmarks. That may or may not matter, depending on how you use your phone, but it's food for thought. http://bgr.com/2017/09/12/iphone-x-benchmark-test-leak-a11-chip-performance/
You're better off going directly to Apple. They have a 24 month payment plan with 0 interest. At the end of 12 months you can trade up if you so desire. 
Your cellular company wants you to buy through them for $250 so they can lock you into another 2 year contract. Buy the phone from Apple and go month-to- month with your provider. And -Add apple care instead of cell company insurance. Much better deal all the way around.
this is how you feed sheep.................post a sale on a 1000 dollar iphone and watch the herd eat it up
Its what all samsung had for the past 2 years!
Nothing special.. oh don't forget samsung Is the Provider of Apple screen lol
Note 8
No doubt
Christina did I offend with my comment about the strap? I've been in the watch biz for a while, I have opinions. I've also been an iPhone fan, but not at $1000. iMac forever though.
LOL OH, that's funny. No offense taken. 
Samsung is yawning.....
Pls  wait for the iPhone infinity
Awesome 
Pls does this iphone 8 has a water resistant feature because i would like to go to the sea bed and laugh at them because it isn't worth $1000
I like iPhones Best security And great tech support. I've had android phones and would not use one if they were giving them away
Actually guys I am iPhone lover ; I just think Apple is racking us over the coals. Apologies to Lee.
Christina Sunshine Wafers somebody wrote go for iPhone 25 that was funny
Christina Cyr
iPhone x is Galaxy 7
Tina Fostines Wells thanks for the advice.
I'm going from Droid back to IPhone as well. It's just a more superior product..

I actually like my 7 dual camera a lot and less to carry when I am traveling
The one made in America will sell for 10,000 due to the cost of manufacturing.
I don't think so: Apple is already charging a nice margin, probably 100:1.  They just need to invest in state if the art MFG facilities (not just headquarters) and to hire American so peeps can buy American-  isn't that the POTUS way, the base desire?
Having not road tested myself, hard to say. 

I owned the first edition of the Apple Watch. As it happens, I bought it to replace my failing Garmin Forerunner 305. I use it in conjunction with Nike+Run Club app and , Nokia (Withings) and Apple Health apps for data tracking. 

Now I am a casual athlete that trains for fitness and wellness purposes. I do not compete. Other than some light weight training, my primary training is by way of road running and rowing on an erg. 

So after two years, I still like my watch. Beyond using it daily for Apple Pay and Wallet, texting and the odd phone call. I find that it has more than met my expectations. It helps manage my technology and day in a discreet way. As a casual athlete, my experience has been good. From friends that use it for cycling, it would seem to be the same too. 

Compared to a dedicated running watch, depending on use and applications, a more serious athlete may find it somewhat finicky or lacking in some features. 

Off course, I wear my watch every day, all day long. Something that I never did with my Garmin or any other sport/training watch. 

As for me, because of the better water resistance and the LTE, I am now considering upgrading to the 3. Hope this has been of help.
Do not make this mistake! You will be regreatful.
iphone is a rip off..
The one that costs the most money
I hate my droid.
David Alexander Lindsay Accepted. I'm only thinking of the iPhone 8 because I'm having trouble with my iPhone 6. Otherwise I would stick with it. I upgrade very seldom.
I use Iphone for 3 months but i realised that android is a big freedom.You can't use your phone and applications as you want at Iphone.You can't put a special map to your main screen or your favourite call.Finding gps is so hard.Open to 3G and 4G is so hard too.Android is freedom
What's you favorite all around device?
Shubham Agrawal sure, put $1000 dollars for an iPhone....NOT! The iPhone 6s or 7 will be more than adequate. BTW, I have an iPhone 7 more than enough
Yeah, I don't really want to spend $1,000 on a phone though. And the Galaxy is like around $800 so either way, it's a lot to consider. I like the idea of being able to Face Time my husband but we do just fine on Facebook Messenger.
Why could I buy the watch?
iPhone 6 or 7 should be fine for you. I have a 7 and it does everything I need

Waiting for apple to come out with a groundreaking edgeless screen. Ahem Samsung 7
Home Depot has wireless charging pads for customers while they wait. Why is Apple so slow on getting nee technology.
I've lost all respect for apple. Off to android I go.
Andriod? Is that like Sorny or Magnetbox?
Yep. Android now looking pretty decent.
Wait for the Next Galaxy android. Android actually tries to bring innovation into their phones. Apple will just continue to release the same phone every year with a slight difference to them. You also have more freedom on an android. They have always allowed people to use an SD card (aside from the galaxy s6).  Apple phones start to not work well after like 3 or 4 years. Some people believe It's because Apple does it on purpose to continue to suck up peoples money.
buy the new iphone X...:D
Wouldn't it be nice if there was a phone manufactured in the United States? Check out @TheCyrclePhone by @dtoor_inc at https://dtoor.com/
did apple just copy android? because these phones have been around for a few years if you are an android user?

What trump has to say bout that ! 
Renewable energies are probably unnecessary at this time and pollution is ok... as long as he can make profit ! BUt in a month the earth has shown us it doesn't need us : 4 hurricanes  3 majors earthquakes , eclipse, invasion of grasshoppers in the Caribbean, floodings in several parts of Asia ! And please don't say we did have these phenomenas before ...cuz scientists themselves said they are at the limits of their knowledge regarding what we have been facing ! 

I'll just keep my islands and Mexico in prayers and do my part as a global citizen ! 
And for the rest of you please stop making uneducated votes! Do us the favor

You are uneducated.  Earthquakes and eclipse has nothing to do with climate change.   And prayer NEVER works, because all you do is making wishes to a stupid VOID.

Maria, grüüüß dich. Danke für alles....
Someone should start pointing the finger at urban planning instead of mother nature.  This area is historic for hurricanes, why wasn't electricity cabled underground when they built? Why is there so much cement that water has nowhere to go and floods everything?  We have to start looking in the mirror for the culprit and take responsibility for past mistakes (read: greed) and fix it.  Whether you believe in climate change or not, the clean earth theory it embraces is a good thing for us all.

Jesus looks in the heart of a person, and never assumes anything. Lord, You are worthy to be praised!!! For Your thoughts are higher than man's and Your ways are higher than man's way.
You are correct Satan hates the prayers of God's people!

It's necessary...
(B.A. Bible/Biology)*

MARINE LIFE: NOT INVENTED BY NATURE 

JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING EXISTS IN NATURE does not mean it originated from nature. If all the chemicals (i.e. amino acids, nucleic acids, etc.) necessary to make a cell were left to themselves, “Mother Nature” would have no ability to organize them into a cell. It requires an already existing cell to bring about another cell. The cell exists and reproduces in nature but nature didn’t invent or design it! Nature didn’t originate the cell or any form of life. An intelligent power outside of nature had to be responsible.

Miller, in his famous experiment in 1953, showed that amino acids (the building blocks of life) could form by chance. But, it’s not enough just to have amino acids. The various amino acids that make-up life must link together in a precise sequence, just like the letters in a sentence, to form functioning protein molecules. It has never been shown that various amino acids can bind together into a sequence by chance to form protein molecules.

Mathematicians have said any event in the universe with odds of 10 to 50th power or greater is impossible! The probability of just an average size protein molecule arising by chance is 10 to the 65th power. Even the simplest cell is made up of many millions of various protein molecules. Also, a partially evolved cell would quickly disintegrate, not wait millions of years to become complete and living.

Natural laws may explain how an airplane or living cell works, but it’s irrational to believe that mere undirected natural laws can bring about the origin of an airplane or a cell. Once you have a complete and living cell then the genetic program and biological machinery exist to direct the formation of more cells, but how could the cell have originated naturally when no directing code and mechanisms existed in nature?

Only evolution within “kinds” is genetically possible (i.e. varieties of dogs, cats, horses, cows, etc.), but not evolution across “kinds” (i.e. from sea sponge to human). How could species have survived if their vital tissues, organs, reproductive systems were still evolving? Survival of the fittest would actually have prevented such evolution!

All species of plants and animals in the fossil record are found complete, fully formed, and fully functional. This is powerful evidence that all species came into existence as complete and fully formed from the beginning. This is only possible by creation.

Only limited evolution, variations of already existing genes and traits are possible. Nature is mindless and has no ability to design and program entirely new genes for entirely new traits.

Natural selection doesn’t produce biological traits or variations. It can only “select” from biological variations that are possible and which have survival value. The real issue is what biological variations are possible, not natural selection.

Modern evolutionists believe and hope that over, supposedly, millions of years, random genetic mutations in the genes of reproductive cells caused by environmental radiation will generate entirely new genes. This is total blind and irrational faith on the part of evolutionists. It’s much like believing that randomly changing the sequence of letters in a romance novel, over millions of years, will turn it into a book on astronomy! That’s the kind of blind faith macro-evolutionists have.

Mutations are accidents in the genetic code, are mostly harmful, and have no capability of producing greater complexity in the code. Even if a good accident occurred, for every good one there would be hundreds of harmful ones with the net result, over time, being harmful, even lethal, to the species. Even if a single mutation is not immediately harmful, the accumulation of mutations over time will be harmful. At best, mutations only produce further variations within a natural species. Most biological variations are not due to mutations but from new combinations of already existing genes.

What about genetic and biological similarities between species? Genetic information, like other forms of information, cannot happen by chance, so it is more logical to believe that genetic and biological similarities between all forms of life are due to a common Designer who designed similar functions for similar purposes. It doesn't mean all forms of life are biologically related! Only genetic similarities within a natural species proves relationship because it's only within a natural species that members can interbreed and reproduce.

The actual similarity between ape and human DNA is between 70-87% not 99.8% as commonly believed. The original research stating 99.8% similarity was based on ignoring contradicting evidence. Only a certain segment of DNA between apes and humans was compared, not the entire DNA genome.

All the fossils that have been used to support human evolution have been found to be either hoaxes, non-human, or human, but not non-human and human (i.e. Neanderthal Man was discovered later to be fully human).

There has never been unanimous agreement among evolutionary scientists on ANY fossil evidence that has been used to support human evolution over the Many years, Including LUCY.

Also, so-called "Junk DNA" isn't junk. Although these "non-coding" segments of DNA don't code for proteins, they have recently been found to be vital in regulating gene expression (i.e. when, where, and how genes are expressed, so they're not "junk"). Also, there is evidence that, in certain situations, they do code for protein.

ACE: Nice lobby, but rooms are taking the "shabby chic" a bit deeper toward the shabby side than the price tag would indicate. I saw folks at night using that small pool mostly as a place to soak their dirty feet, so swim at your own risk. The theatre next door is amazing but relevant only if there is an event you want to attend. The 24 hour small taco stand 1/2 block away is good and cheap. Not all that convenient to subway stops.

The Line: The real deal. Nice rooms with jaw-dropping view of LA (if you pay a little extra for Hollywood Hills rooms, and ask for higher floors) that is revealed to you with a dramatic lifting of power blinds and through a wall of glass, not just a small window. Best lobby food and best poolside food by Roy Choi, and within walking distance to many top notch and cheap Koreatown restaurants. Subway stop across the street.

No, this is due to tectonic plates
There is no scientific studies that can prove that still. Earthquakes are movements of nature that occurs below us and there is no research about connections or relation with climate change or other external causes.

Everything thanks to climate change
Terrifying!prayers for victims and rescuers.
I see. So that's why it was devastating
Ciudad de México is built on top of a lake and a swamp, that doesn't help either.
Really? On top of lakes and swamps?
Our president denies  Global Warming is real we have a summer with record heats and a surge in storms  more  powerful hurricanes and  Earthquakes , floods etc. The Plates in our earth are overheating.  We are intensifying  these storms by the  blissful ignorance of man.  I am not saying storms will not occur they have and do. I am an American in the Caribbean and we are getting hit by storm after storm . These hurricanes  are being called phenominal.  Harvey, Irma ( storm of the century) and Maria.  Puerto Rico was hit  first time in  ninety years.  The Earthquakes on the Pacific and the Storm lidia if this is the beginnning we are doomed. We must not add fuels to fires and Yes  GLOBAL WARMING is real. I am not saying storms do not occur naturally but we need not to speed up the process. God Bless Mexico City,
You could read furthermore on Google, look up "Mexico City lake"

Earthquakes have nothing to do with global warming, they're tectonic plates always shifting around.

Anyone want to bet Trump doesn't offer to send our search & rescue teams (with cadaver dogs) down to Mexico to help save people buried in all of those buildings -- something all previous presidents surely have done in similar situations? That would be the HUMAN thing to do, the CHRISTIAN thing to do, and the NEIGHBORLY thing to do -- the complete opposite of what Trump would or will do!

Praying for yours Edwin Corona, Julieta and the rest of our team and TTEC employees and your families safety. Be safe always. May God grace be upon you.
To all my friends from around the world, I wouldn’t normally ask something like this, but the situation is quite serious.

Please donate to Topos, a rescue team that was formed during the 1985 earthquake in Mexico City. Today, Mexico suffered another catastrophic earthquake that already has taken many lives.

YOU CAN HELP EVEN IF YOU ARENT IN MEXICO. Your dollars are worth almost double in Mexico, so something small as $15 has a big impact. you can donate, even a little bit, you can do it directly here:

If you can share with any friends or family that are interested in helping, the people from my city would appreciate it a lot. 

Thank you and lots of love!

The crust of the earth is thin as it is Fraking in my homestate of Texas  and much damage to our roads. Earthquakes in Oklahoma and no this is not real?  Really   We should do away with emission testing NOT.  Pollution and deadly gases . What about the  Japanese Nuclear plant  Furishimo that is still burning can we mention places humans can not live due to Nuclear fall out parts of Russia etc once beautiful  habitabal and not wastelands.

Guess who's making the Earthquake happen: GOD. Guess who's responsible for our living and dying: GOD. If you think praying to the thing trying to get rid of you is going to stop it, then you really are meant to die. End of story. Natural selection.

You people are too backwards. Praying hasn't saved you, God is pissed and he turns genocidal when he's pissed in case you hadn't read the Bible and all the many times he's wiped out humanity completely.

"God flooded the Earth because of how bad humans were but let's pray to him and show him we're better and smarter now by getting on our knees and crying internally until the problem goes away!"

When we fail to render aid or even exhibit compassion, we cease to be a civilized nation
Greg Mahany, way to make this political. You sir, are trash!
Greg Mahany, then how about you stop politicizing and assuming and just offer condolences and your help.
There is no use arguing. People in both America and Mexico suffering from these disasters need help, not argument. We should try coming together more and getting facts before forming baseless opinions.
There is no way to really prepare for these earthquakes us Alaskans are constantly wondering when we are going to get the "BIG" earthquake. I was in the 1964 earthquake at 9.1 shook for two minutes! Largest on record for North America. My heart is breaking and goes out to Mexico. Earthquakes are scary to us Alaskans always! Prayers Mexico
Mike Turner nice short memory. The Topos (moles), Mexican trained group of canine search and rescue volunteers, were at the WTC in 9/11. 

They would have even looked for you if you were trapped.
Its really scary i remember the time when we underwent the same situation with the 8.5 magnitude earthquake in pakistan
Ceidy L Moser Why? You're in a hurry to go to Hell? Because God seems in a hurry to send all of you there. Oh, I hope you're not one of those ignorant idiots that thinks Satan snatches your evil soul out of your body when you die if you've been bad. No no, you are judge at St-Peter's Gate, the Gate to Heaven. Then God sends you to Hell if you've been evil because Hell is a prison.

God created the Heavens, then presumably Earth, but also Hell. Because, before Adam and Eve were made, Satan was sent to Hell. So Hell existed BEFORE humans because when "Satan tempted Eve", he'd already been banished from Heaven.

God had planned for evil by making a prison. God knew evil existed and didn't stop it because God is not omnipotent, is not capable of stopping evil for he himself is also evil, just like the humans created in his image whom are capable of both good and evil. Why wouldn't God be capable of Evil if humans (created in HIS image) are capable of it?

And if God is a spirit, how can a spirit feel compassion? Feelings are physical, chemicals that go off in your brain. Spirits don't have chemicals or brains... Nothing about this religion adds up.
And Chris Angel is a better illusionist than Jesus was. Seriously, with what that dude can do, you don't think that JUST MAYBE, Jesus was a good illusionist and tried to get people to follow him and his religion that he made up? Because all the stories in the Bible are stories that exist in FAR older texts from older religions and lore.

You just blindly believe like you're told to do and anyone who questioned the religion was hunted down and called a heretic. Seems to me like someone was trying to keep people stupid and from knowing the truth. Because when analyzed, none of it makes ANY sense.
Puebla is not the 2nd largest city in Mexico Lori, Guadalajara is, then Monterrey.  They mean earthquake epicenter
Ok. But they should name the city, is my point. Many ny ers are from Puebla
Other than if they were just moral stories people took too seriously...Because I learned Sodomy, rape, incest and violence from the Bible. I learned God is genocidal and throws tantrums like my toddlers do, I also learned from the Bible that my children were born impure and had to be "reborn" through Baptism because of what Adam and Eve did...WAY way back. Yup, we're still getting punished for what WE didn't do...

Speaking of which, that lie about Eve being the first woman. Go learn about Lilith and Samael before you decide you know your religion.

I hope our government offers to help you. I know that you offered to help us in Texas and in Florida and I understand our government did not respond to your offer of help. I apologize for this.

Yet the skyscraper did not fall down or explode into powder .. hmm.. jet fuel is some pretty powerful stuff.  Kind of surprised the The New York Times never investigated 9/11, but they're not real journalists and they don't actually do their jobs, sooo ... I guess I'm not that surprised.

Yeah crazy and very tragic
Lori Mark I agree
Mexico city is very pollutedI have been there  and there are no emissions buses. cars black smoke in fact I see the worst  records dated back to the 80's  this proves not what you think at all.  Because sadly Mexico city is on the fault line and much is built on landfill. Mexico city has no emissions smog is bad pollution all contribute to global warming we are not denying storms are part of a natural occurence  and ongoing one . But all you have proven rom records when cars, airpanes , gases  corporations seeping this into the ground,  released in the atmosphere  are inceasing and adding to and not subtracting the level of which these storms are at. I am in Barbados  the caribbean where I live on  and off . I have seen the effects of Global warming up close and personal . You will never tell me it is not real and does not  cause the already existence weather patterns to create more voilent storms.
Deadliest one since the SAME DATE in 1985. That is crazy!
The Ring Of Fire Just Moved Mexico City With An EarthQuake Of Magnitude 7.1.
Sickened that the string of Tweets by various celebs were basically "Sorry,  I'm thinking of you." Guess what? Mexico doesn't need your thoughts, they need your action. Don't just Tweet "Dude, that sucks bro" and go on your day like you just accomplished something meaningful or helpful. Sure, thoughts and prayers are important....but if that's ALL you do, then you've really done nothing at all for these people. I have yet to see a Tweet from a celeb that says, "I'm donating $10 to aid and I'm flying over right now to see what I can do in person. Who is with me?" Many Americans can't do much outside of donate money (can't afford a plane ticket or to fly to another country at the drop of a hat) and that's okay, but celebs have the means to do more.....yet they don't. I think if you're a celebrity, you're better off not Tweeting anything unless you are physically doing something to help. It's vile to think that someone with Millions of dollars is sitting in their mansion in Malibu Tweeting, "So sorry for Mexico."....while they run outside to lounge by their pool and don't lift a finger further. Actions speak louder than Tweets.
Well Greg, with over 3000 team members prepositioned for Puerto Rico, resources may be a bit thin. But I am confident a USAR team will be deployed if requested.
Ricardo Diaz mira
the actual number of dead in the 85 earthquake was around 100,000. the government lied about the numbers
what do earthquakes have to do with global warming?
Mary Hiland maybe you think there is hate because that is what you feel. We are not asking about other leaders. We are trying ro help each other here. What are you talking about?

Hey! I'm ok :) thanks for asking
Dave Hoff Wouldn't they have to be requested to go by our president?  That is exactly my point!
Lord have mercy amen.
I never said it's not real, learn to PAY ATTENTION to what people say before you go randomly crazy. Hahahahaha! Earthquakes are not linked to global warming, they function solely on tectonic plates!! The chart I showed everyone on here states that nothing had changed on the tectonic movement, regardless of how much more we're advancing in technologies over the years, and destroying the planet.
By the way, Mexico city is far different from when you visited back in the 20's, 50's, and 90's, you'd be surprised to know it was rated the top, cleanest city of the world between 5 and 8 years ago.

Have a good day, and you're welcome for the lessons—free of charge.
yes, she's very angry with all of us
He's already not done it after the previous earth quake... AFTER mexico sent aid to texas after Hurricane Harvey, which they rightfully took back after Trumpster fire offered not even sympathetic words to our neighbors to the south.
Sorry, our cadaver dogs are busy looking for bodies of hurricane victims. But we have about 800,000 people we can send to help rebuild Mexico.
Schrecklich. 
Look, I am not a Trump sycophant,  but where do you all get your information from? Trump was very quick to publicly give his condolences and offer aid. He clearly said that our country would be there for Mexico. At the same time, we are currently dealing with our own natural disasters and trying to help those in need here in our country. Our resources can only stretch so far and we should always help ourselves first. That is not to say that we don't care about other countries.
Thank you for that!

Mike Turner correct now let’s gtfo Middle East and North Korea oh wait you Trump Snowflakes rather wage wars.
Not only did they offer, they have been helping in texas the last few days. Some of them are flying back to Mexico today to help their own.
My thoughts with Mexico but Illegal seems to be the key word in first half. Wouldnt face issues if it was legal.
WTH?! How is that relevant in this moment?
México  
There are also concerns that global warming will release the potent greenhouse gas methane from permafrost and continental shelves, creating a dangerous feedback to global warming itself.

But McGuire is talking about changes deep in the Earth’s crust, caused by the lifting or imposing of the weight of ice and ocean water at the surface. And the concern relates to earthquakes as well as volcanoes. For earthquakes, the evidence points to changes in sea levels, as well as the melting of ice.

Many geological fault lines are on a knife-edge, awaiting any nudge to send their seismic mayhem to the surface, says McGuire. His University College London colleague Serge Guillas has found that, over the past 40 years, El Nino cycles in the tropical Pacific Ocean have triggered a regular seismic response as the pressure of water has changed with short-term sea level fluctuations. There are more earthquakes in the eastern Pacific in the months after the cycle lowers sea levels in the area by a few centimeters, which flexes the plates beneath.

FRIENDS OF THE WORLD

Topos is a rescue team that was formed during the 1985 earthquake in Mexico. Created by a group of young Mexican Men and Women that helped rescue people in the aftermath of a massive earthquake that killed 10,000 people. Yesterday, at their anniversary, Mexico suffered another catastrophic earthquake that already has taken the life of at least 140 people with hundreds more trapped within the rubble of the collapsed buildings

YOU CAN HELP EVEN IF YOU ARENT IN MEXICO. Your money is worth almost double in Mexico, so something as small as $15, £10, 50 aed has a big impact. If you feel like making a donation, even a little one, you can do it directly here:

This hurts me! So sad
Mary Hiland Mexico never asked for your help, we help each other, and he may not be the best president but Nieto is sure as hell better than yours and is out there with the people helping. 
Mike Turner a lot of other countries have sent their condolences and help, troops from countries like Israel and south American countries are on their way to help, and once again, no one asked for your help.
Maybe he was suggesting that the illegals go back to Mexico and help rebuild it?
Dan Olla Again, another ignorant and non-empathetic reply. Sad. So sad.
So tragic !!
Assustador
We request the aid of Rohan.
Debbie Miller such a nice person , probably a church going " Christian"
I"ll bet a good earthquake in California would kill more Mexicans than one in Mexico . Still can't figure Greg out .
Carolina Rose
Carmen Martínez Coulson, you may have a chip on your shoulder about Christians or what you percieve to be Christian, but stating the truth about a lack of resources and an abundance of illegals is not being mean. Facts don't care about your feelings.
Carmen Martínez Coulson, exactly what was said that would call for karma?
We've had disasters since the dawn of mankind. Plagues, famines, wars, Holocausts, tsunamis...are you that self centered that you think because it's our turn and it's hitting close to home this time that it's God? Was God showing he was displeased when he destroyed 1/3 of the earths population during the Middle Ages when people were extremely religious?
Think what you will Shannon and don't judge me ..you don't know me as I am far from self centered ..and  FYI ... I live no where near where any of these tragedies have taken place....so it would appear that you don't know everything either ...who knew ??
Gina
Jessica Auletta I would say mocking the hardship that the Mexican people is suffering right now, along with the fear that undocumented immigrants (Mexican and otherwise) are feeling of being deported and lose everything they have worked for in the US calls for karma. If you are not helping or showing empathy, keep silent. Such opinions help no one, and demonstrate a hardened heart
Joanna Bruneau so you're not in the US? Funny then, that the tsunamis and earthquakes and famines that have been happening all over the world didn't cause you to come to the same conclusion.
You make many assumptions .... and again with the judging .. Do you know for sure that this I the first time that I have stated this ?? hmmm
I mean how many times has Ethiopia had famines in the last forty years? So God starved all of them to death because he was displeased with them? How many times has Zaire and the Sudan dealt with Ebola? Oh wait not on your radar either. But oddly enough, no earthquakes or tsunamis or hurricanes when the Germans were perpetuating the Holocaust. I guess God was happy with them, then.
Rodrigo Lopez Vargas, I believe turning this entire disaster into a political echo chamber is demonstrating a hardened heart. But since it has turned into that thanks to Greg and others, I will say that it is unfortunate that illegals (or undocumented immigrants as you call them, though nonetheless illegal) should have to lose everything when being deported, however it was against the law to come here illegally in the first place and deportation is fair, just, and lawful. They knew the risks of breaking the law, which is in place for good reasons. Geographic location should not dictate who should be allowed to break the law and enter here illegally. But, I digress since none of that is what is important right now. So I agree that not showing empathy is uncalled for. Just like the initial comment in this thread.
Pray for them
We are not expecting help from Trump.. nor do we need it... the wonderful community of expats in our city is doing its fare share of collaboration, giving a great example of what being a good neighbor is all about.
Lay off the holy wine, lady
Have a blessed day !!
Donna Gadbaw Mitchell  don't care about people. Don't care what you think. Another BS religious nut I assume. Go take in the homeless. People can stick it. I've lived long enough to know about human nature, and believe me, you're no different.
Jessica Auletta Jesus is a historical figure. He is not a god. Just because people read a book and have a belief doesn't make it true.  There are 4200 different beliefs worldwide. I doubt anyone has the truth.
Scary.
Dan Olla, I am sorry that you feel the need to knock others for something that doesn't hurt you or effect your life negatively in any way. I suppose you need the attention that comes with your rudeness. You are entitled to your beliefs and opinions, as is everyone else. I have and will continue to defend your right to voice that opinion, however uncalled for and disrespectful it may be. Have a blessed day.

It did not seem like she meant that, but it could be since her broken English is hard to understand. I feel sorry you lack this, but I'm not going to try and instill a sense of humanity and empathy on any of you. It's not my role to teach you how to be a good human. 

I'd just like to remind you that at this very moment there are rescue teams and civilians digging through collapsed buildings trying to find survivors. Thank you for showing us your racism and prejudices during this critical moment, but we really don't need them. Please keep them to yourself. 

México knows the meaning of humanity and solidarity. We've come out of this before and we will do it again.

So far, hundreds of people have worked through the night to rescue children trapped in their schools. Mobile internet providers have enabled wifi around the city and made calls and messages free. There are large scale collection efforts at universities and government offices to provide water, food and other basics to volunteers and hospitals. Residents have welcomed people into their houses. The airport is open, functioning and will begin receiving international aid.

All religions are evil. They hurt all of society. Live and let live, and stop thinking you have a moral high ground because of an unrealistic belief.
Take your own advice. Live and let live, and let people openly express their faith without cutting them down for no reason for it.
Jessica Auletta  this whole discussion got started by some condescending so called Christian.  Christianity is a joke. People don't need religion to care about others. The kindest people I have ever met are the non religious.
I can see you like to go around in circles. I have no interest in converting you into my beliefs and I know you will never change my faith either. I no longer wish to participate in your attention seeking grudge. If you have something positive to add to the original discussion, I would enjoy talking that over with you.
Victor Zarate
Jessica Auletta  lol. I have no grudge. I was replying to the man who started this conversation, and you commented on mine. I don't care what anyone believes. But since Christianity was brought up I responded. If every so-called Christian took in a homeless person, homelessness would be solved. But instead people are acting all high and mighty because Mexico had an earthquake?  Americans don't even care about each other, let alone people from another country. That's a fact. 
I believe Jesus Christ said his words would fall on deaf ears. He is right about that one.
México strong 
Just because you say something is true doesn't make it true. Carbon emissions might affect the global temperature, but certainly not to the degree you seem to think they do. Even if they did, I wouldn't stop human progress for the sake of saving the Earth. And tree huggers such as yourself want to hold America back by forcing American industries to adopt unreliable, inefficient, and inferior energy such as solar and wind. If you rallied for nuclear energy implementation, I'd be right there with you, but you fear nuclear too much to push for it.
Marino Spinoza OMG
Excuse me I am not a tree hugger and I am for alternatives that work. I am from Texas and live on and off in Barbados. Imagine a little island has more solar panels and energy than our developed USA. Because  Big Utillities have made it impossible to  use Solar energy we are being hijacked by BIg Pharma etc brainwashed sheep to.     We must  have regualtions  in place  look at BP every other country they had to  have  strict regulations to save two million on a required safety valve they compromised and completely destroyed some Wetlands in Louisiana so I am standing with the Standing Rock Sioux.  Back to Solar Energy   I use ACs taht are a combo off both and one day plan to go completely off grid. Solar  It works. Oh and looked into solar energy in the USA some places do not allow this  because GOD forbid we tap into the   Big Company profits.  I  am for fuel effecencies and emmissions and RELIABLE alternatives. Tree Hugger not but  I stil say we need to stop fraking you want to see the damage come to my natibe West Texas ok.

Yes girl, they are incommunicated. Everything is down. 
Almost all ham radio operators have backup power (and things like solar to charge) and run low power in bad situation. 

You can run for quite a while and the other station (Cincinnati) for example...a lot of times can use a beam antenna to get the best signal off of a low power station. 

My point is, there should be plenty of ability to communicate further. That wasn't a "lucky" communication . They can do it again whenever needed.
Joe Bass if I was coming across as  saying the ability for communication was lucky, I apologize. If anything, the luck was because someone cared enough to reach out. My post had more to do with the snarkiness of earlier comments about the report being a cat 5 storm caused damage. The greater context is that someone cared enough to reach out
Stephen!  Ham!
Dianne Williams  1st. It did not happened for Katrina, no immediate help!!.. many people die, during & days  after the storm. 2nd. The islands are in the path of seasonal hurricanes, for centuries been like that!. so, you prepare... build accordingly, stock all necessities, have generators in "bunker generator "... So be prepared for "after the storm effect ".......  it can be done.... But don't cry, " we are destroyed, knowing that harm could possible happen"... once again, islands located in the path of seasonal hurricanes, storms.
Let's hear it for hams!!!
HAM radio operators were invaluable after Katrina.  Supposedly, one even ran the commercial shipping traffic on the MS River from a Gretna living room for days on end....some of the landline phone lines were still working, but jammed in daylight hours. They worked in the middle of the night.  All cellphone towers, destroyed or down.  All electricity, down.  All cable TV and broadcast TV and radio, down.  All roads, blocked, flooded, or destroyed. Airport closed. No way to communicate.  it was awful.

My reply was to make sure that people understand that damage reports are part of the requested data.  I'm pretty sure this is from the Hurricane Watch Network.  These are hams that work with the National Hurricane Center, who want damage reports.   We also are not hearing the entire conversation.   But very likely this info is given off to  relief agencies as well so they have an idea of how many people they will be needing to assist.
With  all due respect Rudolph our houses are built to withstand  hurricanes.  This is why you  find that most of the damages that occur to our houses are due to landslides  as well  as  from raging rivers which claim any path they may.  Sometimes roofs  fly away but it is not an entire population.  During  hurricanes we usually have a high survival rate.  This hurricane was no category  3  hurricane. This was a category 5 hurricane and there is no amount of preparation on island that can prepare you for a storm  that big! We as a Caribbean nation have procedures put in place to help ourselves in times like these. If people are in need of help should they not call for help!?.   Many times we speak on things and say the harshes things because  we are not in the situation. You would prefer  people not cry out for help in a time of need because they live in an area that is prone to hurricanes. We need to be a little more empathetic towards people. No matter where they are from.  The United States is not the one helping out in the Caribbean .  We as a caricom nation are helping out ourselves  so what's the problem ?
Amateur radio and ham radio are the same thing!
Wow incredible 
I have always been in wonder of the radio system- when everything is down that's still reliable-
A very good friend of mine runs the net out of Columbus Ohio. I seldom get on , just to busy but if I ever retire I plan on being active on the net. They do a great job.
Diamond Kelly Paris ... no problem here. My comment is based on what I read. And am ignorant of your conditions of infrastructures, obviously I don't live there, although I have visited a few islands in the region.....  Cat 3 or cat 5 storm, or cat 7, means for the people to be prepared for the worst!! Experience dictates how to prepare and add a measure of vision to mitigate damage. Guess best thing people did, was to evacuate to neighboring islands!!!!  God bless you all!!
I thought radio was so old fashioned

Dave Albright you should forward the article to your dad!
Saul Fussiner So this afternoon I was thinking that with the cell towers down people must have been leaving the island to communicate, because how else would they?. Yeah...ham radio. Those radio waves travel FAR! And I feel dumb
I'd appreciate it if god gave more than just arbitrary feelings.
Don’t make this about politics. Besides, Still waiting for America to be great again!
Yes.  Especially this year it would be helpful to have an operational station to help handle communication when all other modes fail.
Inactive for some time, and I might rethink that, given so many disasters, if only to light up the rig in times of need.

Ham-radio operators are priceless. My grandpa, BuzzBomb and my dad, WB2ANK out of Jersey years ago would talk to people from all over and outside North American. If you know someone that is an operator, contact them to help raise the islands
When cell phones go down, no power, no internet which are new and fashionable people turn to Ham Radio which is old fashioned but works so well, get your license and the old fashioned world will open up for you and you will never be out of touch, Tim N7SBU.

Very often, the information discovered by 'pure' research can be put to practical use. A classic example would be penicillin. Alexander Fleming was not doing medical research when he discovered one of the world's most important antibiotics; he was just studying molds.

THE JUMPING FROG: NOT INVENTED BY NATURE 

JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING EXISTS IN NATURE does not mean it originated from nature. If all the chemicals (i.e. amino acids, nucleic acids, etc.) necessary to make a cell were left to themselves, “Mother Nature” would have no ability to organize them into a cell. It requires an already existing cell to bring about another cell. The cell exists and reproduces in nature but nature didn’t invent or design it! Nature didn’t originate the cell or any form of life. An intelligent power outside of nature had to be responsible.

Miller, in his famous experiment in 1953, showed that amino acids (the building blocks of life) could form by chance. But, it’s not enough just to have amino acids. The various amino acids that make-up life must link together in a precise sequence, just like the letters in a sentence, to form functioning protein molecules. It has never been shown that various amino acids can bind together into a sequence by chance to form protein molecules.

Mathematicians have said any event in the universe with odds of 10 to 50th power or greater is impossible! The probability of just an average size protein molecule arising by chance is 10 to the 65th power. Even the simplest cell is made up of many millions of various protein molecules. Also, a partially evolved cell would quickly disintegrate, not wait millions of years to become complete and living.

Natural laws may explain how an airplane or living cell works, but it’s irrational to believe that mere undirected natural laws can bring about the origin of an airplane or a cell. Once you have a complete and living cell then the genetic program and biological machinery exist to direct the formation of more cells, but how could the cell have originated naturally when no directing code and mechanisms existed in nature?

Only evolution within “kinds” is genetically possible (i.e. varieties of dogs, cats, horses, cows, etc.), but not evolution across “kinds” (i.e. from sea sponge to human). How could species have survived if their vital tissues, organs, reproductive systems were still evolving? Survival of the fittest would actually have prevented such evolution!

All species of plants and animals in the fossil record are found complete, fully formed, and fully functional. This is powerful evidence that all species came into existence as complete and fully formed from the beginning. This is only possible by creation.

Only limited evolution, variations of already existing genes and traits are possible. Nature is mindless and has no ability to design and program entirely new genes for entirely new traits.

Natural selection doesn’t produce biological traits or variations. It can only “select” from biological variations that are possible and which have survival value. The real issue is what biological variations are possible, not natural selection.

Modern evolutionists believe and hope that over, supposedly, millions of years, random genetic mutations in the genes of reproductive cells caused by environmental radiation will generate entirely new genes. This is total blind and irrational faith on the part of evolutionists. It’s much like believing that randomly changing the sequence of letters in a romance novel, over millions of years, will turn it into a book on astronomy! That’s the kind of blind faith macro-evolutionists have.

Mutations are accidents in the genetic code, are mostly harmful, and have no capability of producing greater complexity in the code. Even if a good accident occurred, for every good one there would be hundreds of harmful ones with the net result, over time, being harmful, even lethal, to the species. Even if a single mutation is not immediately harmful, the accumulation of mutations over time will be harmful. At best, mutations only produce further variations within a natural species. Most biological variations are not due to mutations but from new combinations of already existing genes.

What about genetic and biological similarities between species? Genetic information, like other forms of information, cannot happen by chance, so it is more logical to believe that genetic and biological similarities between all forms of life are due to a common Designer who designed similar functions for similar purposes. It doesn't mean all forms of life are biologically related! Only genetic similarities within a natural species proves relationship because it's only within a natural species that members can interbreed and reproduce.

The actual similarity between ape and human DNA is between 70-87% not 99.8% as commonly believed. The original research stating 99.8% similarity was based on ignoring contradicting evidence. Only a certain segment of DNA between apes and humans was compared, not the entire DNA genome.

All the fossils that have been used to support human evolution have been found to be either hoaxes, non-human, or human, but not non-human and human (i.e. Neanderthal Man was discovered later to be fully human).

There has never been unanimous agreement among evolutionary scientists on ANY fossil evidence that has been used to support human evolution over the Many years, Including LUCY.

Also, so-called "Junk DNA" isn't junk. Although these "non-coding" segments of DNA don't code for proteins, they have recently been found to be vital in regulating gene expression (i.e. when, where, and how genes are expressed, so they're not "junk"). Also, there is evidence that, in certain situations, they do code for protein.

Non-Newtonian fluids have been found to have a wide variety of technological and/or functional applications...

You're relying upon a non-Newtonian fluid right now to help circulate your blood cells and to keep your cell walls lubricated against each other so that you can, you know, move.

Now if only scientists could find technological and/or functional applications for ignorance, then we'd be set...

I'm telling y'all. The earth Is trying to tell us something.
Just terrible, where do you evacuate to if you are on an island!

Scientists have been saying for ages that when the Arctic ices melt, waters will rise and land will sink to the bottom...

Huh? Puerto Rico is utterly bankrupt. There is no money to rebuild. Their grid is ancient. Have no clue how this is going to shake out. The GOP today approved 1.5 trillion in tax cuts, & they swear the wall is going forward. Not sure what to say anymore.

David Hitchman ur so called god has nothing to do with this. its down to human greed and not taking care of the planet we abuse im guessing david god is behind global warming aint he tut tut tut
hope everyone is safe and sound out there praying for you all
